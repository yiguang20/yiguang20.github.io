伊戈尔・维特科夫斯基
and the Nazi Bell
还有纳粹钟



October 2009 二零零九年十月


Kerry Cassidy (KC): Okay, here we go. Let me ask my question again. Bill, you’ve just come from experiencing the Nazi Bell and whatever else was up there. 凯莉・卡西迪 (KC) : 好了，我们开始吧。让我再问一次。比尔，你刚刚体验过纳粹钟和其他什么东西

Bill Ryan (BR): Ah, you can take two on that, because I wasn’t experiencing the Nazi Bell. I went to take a look at the Henge... 比尔・莱恩 (BR) : 啊，你可以承受两次，因为我没有经历过纳粹钟。我去看了看那个巨石柱..

KC: Okay. [laughs] 好吧。(笑)

BR: ...so, start again.

KC: Okay. [laughs] 好吧。(笑)

BR: You don’t know what you’re doing anymore. You have no idea what’s going on. Go on. 比尔：你已经不知道自己在做什么了。你不知道发生了什么。继续

KC: [laughing] No, that is not true. Stop it. KC: (笑) 不，不是这样的，别说了

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

KC: Okay. Maybe, I don’t like.... Okay. So, you just came back from experiencing the Henge and the surrounding area. What can you tell me? Was it spooky? 好的。也许，我不喜欢... ..。好吧。那么你刚刚体验完巨石柱和周边地区回来。你能告诉我什么？是不是很诡异？

[video clips of Henge - like structure and surrounding area] [影片剪辑了像巨石柱一样的结构和周围地区]

BR: It was a visual experience, because the thing was larger than I had ever imagined it to be, because on the internet you see these little tiny pictures taken with a wide angle lens when it wasn’t nearly so overgrown. And when you’re underneath this thing, this is a huge, huge thing. It’s supported on these big pillars that are far larger than a man, and the whole thing is a very dramatic object indeed. Right in the middle of these woods. It took us a long time to get there, because the snow is about a foot thick, and there are a lot of fallen trees and branches and things, so you’ve got to bushwhack your way through it. And, you’d never know... 比尔：那是一次视觉体验，因为那东西比我想象的要大，因为在互联网上，你可以看到这些用广角镜头拍摄的小照片，当时它还没有那么大。当你在这个东西下面的时候，这是一个巨大的东西。它由这些比人类大得多的大柱子支撑着，整个建筑确实是一个非常引人注目的物体。就在树林中央。我们花了很长时间才到达那里，因为雪有一英尺厚，还有很多倒下的树木和树枝，所以你必须在丛林中艰难地穿行。而且你永远不会知道..

KC: But in the picture it looks like it’s out in the middle of [an] open area with cement. 但是照片上看起来好像是在一片空地的中间，有水泥

BR: Those pictures were taken a very long time ago. 比尔：那些照片是很久以前拍的

KC: I see. And now it’s become overgrown? 我明白了。现在它长得太茂盛了？

BR: It’s completely overgrown. You’d never find this thing... 比尔：完全杂草丛生。你永远也找不到这东西... ..

KC: Oh. KC: 哦

BR: ...unless you knew exactly where to look. 比尔: ... 除非你知道该去哪里找

[video clip showing insides of the tunnels] [显示隧道内部情况的视频剪辑]

KC: Okay. So they used prisoners though, up there... KC: 好的，所以他们使用了囚犯，在那里..

BR: Oh yeah. 比尔：哦，是的

KC: ...isn’t that true?

BR: This is forced labor. The Nazis... 比尔：这是强迫劳动。纳粹... ..

KC: Yeah. 没错

BR: ...used forced labor in many of their factories and this is how come they were able to establish such an efficient industrial machine, because they were working in a totalitarian environment under conditions of huge brutality, and if there’s any residue of bad feeling in these areas...

Another man: Uh-huh 另一个男人：嗯

BR: ...it can be easily understood because a lot of people suffered hugely in those places, in ways that I don’t think we can imagine these days.

[recording ends and then resumes with Bill Ryan talking in front of a tunnel entrance] (录音结束，然后继续，比尔・瑞恩在隧道入口前讲话)

BR: Why people come to a place like this is because we all have a fascination for our own unknown history. This is why Americans come to Europe. This is why we go to visit ancient castles. This is why you went to Egypt. It’s to answer questions that we may not even have properly formulated, but there’s a sense of the unknown in our own minds, and it’s like an itch that you have to scratch, however dark it may be. 比尔：人们之所以来到这样的地方，是因为我们都对自己未知的历史感到着迷。这就是美国人来欧洲的原因。这就是我们去参观古堡的原因。这就是你去埃及的原因。这是为了回答一些我们甚至都没有正确阐述过的问题，但是在我们自己的头脑中有一种未知的感觉，就像是一种不得不挠的渴望，无论它有多黑暗

KC: Yeah. 没错

BR: And so there’s this kind of grim fascination with 比尔：所以有这种严酷的迷恋what is it 怎么了 that we’re all jointly responsible for in our society, in our civilization. What is it, you know, that we’re trying to whitewash over, these days. And maybe there are clues here to how savage mankind can be, and it may be very valuable for us to be reminded of that, even in this day and age where life feels so comfortable, where life feels so easy, where things feel so safe. Maybe that’s an illusion. Maybe it’s appropriate for us to remind ourselves about, you know, how man’s inhumanity to man is always there, like a dormant volcano. 我们共同对我们的社会，我们的文明负责。你知道，我们这些天试图粉饰的是什么。也许这里有一些线索可以告诉我们人类是多么的野蛮，提醒我们这一点可能是非常有价值的，即使在这个生活感觉如此舒适的时代，在这个生活感觉如此轻松的时代，在这个事情感觉如此安全的时代。也许这只是一种幻觉。也许我们应该提醒自己，你知道，人类对人类的不人道永远存在，就像一座休眠的火山

[recording ends and then resumes with Bill Ryan talking in front of the Henge-like structure] (录音结束，比尔・瑞恩在巨石阵般的建筑物前面讲话)

BR: So this is Bill Ryan from Project Camelot and it’s the 15th of October, 2009. And I’ll repeat the month again: it’s October, it’s not December. So, Robert Felix from 比尔・莱恩：这是来自卡米洛特计划的比尔・莱恩，现在是 2009 年 10 月 15 日。我再重复一遍这个月份：现在是十月，不是十二月。罗伯特・菲利克斯iceagenow 伊奇诺 would be quite interested in the strange anomalous weather that we’ve been experiencing here. This is pretty unusual stuff. We’ve got quite a few inches of snow, maybe even up to a foot in places. And what you can see behind me here over my left shoulder is this object that has become a sort of an iconic representation for all that is not yet fully understood about the Nazi technology, the advanced technology. 会对我们这里奇怪的反常天气很感兴趣。这是相当不寻常的东西。我们这里的积雪有几英寸厚，有些地方甚至厚达一英尺。你们可以从我的左肩看到，这个物体已经成为了一种标志性的代表，对于纳粹的技术，先进的技术，还没有完全了解

That there is a lot of evidence that is gradually being accumulated by Igor Witkowski and others, that during the second world war the Nazis were experimenting with things that even now, 60 years later, we might not fully understand in the public domain. And a little later on in this video you’ll be seeing us talking with Igor in detail about the evidence that he’s amassed to suggest very strongly to many other researchers that the Nazis were doing something very, very strange and that this project here, which has become known as the Nazi Bell, may well have been the most top secret of all their top secret projects. 伊戈尔・维特科夫斯基和其他人正在逐渐积累大量的证据，二战期间纳粹正在试验的东西，直到 60 年后的今天，我们在公共领域可能还不能完全理解。稍后在这段视频中，你将看到我们和伊戈尔详细讨论他收集的证据，这些证据强烈地向其他研究人员表明，纳粹正在做一些非常、非常奇怪的事情，这个被称为纳粹钟的项目，很可能是他们所有绝密项目中最高机密的

And we’ve just been battling our way through the woods and the snow as you have seen. And the first thing that struck me, is that this structure here is enormous. I’ve seen photographs of it on the internet, as many of you watching this video will have done also. And I had not been prepared for something that was quite this large. We’ll be talking with Igor later about what this was. It bears some strong resemblance to water towers, but Igor has done a lot of research in this area, and we don’t actually know for sure what it was used for. It’s not the only piece of evidence at all which suggests the reality of these experiments that the Nazis were doing. 正如你们所看到的，我们正在努力穿越森林和大雪。第一件让我震惊的事情是，这里的结构是巨大的。我在互联网上看到过它的照片，正如你们中的许多人看到这个视频后也会这样做。我没有料到会发生这么大的事情。我们稍后会和伊戈尔讨论这是怎么回事。它和水塔有很多相似之处，但伊戈尔在这个领域做了很多研究，我们实际上不知道它是用来做什么的。这并不是唯一一个证明纳粹正在进行这些实验的证据

It’s interesting and it’s visible. And as you can see here, it’s pretty dramatic, but actually the core, the solid core of the evidence that suggests a reality of what the Nazis were doing, actually lies elsewhere. 这很有趣，而且是可见的。正如你在这里看到的，这是相当戏剧性的，但实际上，核心，证据的坚实核心，表明了纳粹正在做什么的现实，实际上在别处

[recording ends and then resumes with Kerry walking inside the tunnels] (录音结束，然后继续，克里走进隧道)

KC: They shut these people in the mountain and they killed them with a chemical weapon before they closed the mountain doors so that they couldn’t escape even if they were able to crawl through the tunnels or something of that nature. So it’s really quite a dark scenario. The whole area feels dark. I mean, it felt dark since we arrived. KC: 他们把这些人关在山里，用化学武器杀了他们，然后关上山门，这样即使他们能爬过隧道或其他类似的东西，也无法逃脱。所以这真的是一个非常黑暗的场景。整个区域感觉很黑暗。我的意思是，自从我们来到这里，天就黑了

[Kerry walking] [克里走]

I don’t think it’s my imagination that the deeper you go in, the darker it feels. [video of an old plaque on wall of tunnel] I don’t actually know if it comes out any better than this. Of course we can’t read Polish, but apparently they put up a plaque in 1994. So it’s not all that long ago. 我不认为这是我的想象，你陷得越深，感觉越黑暗。(隧道墙上的一块古老牌匾的视频) 我真的不知道它是不是比这个更好。当然我们不会读波兰语，但是很明显他们在 1994 年就挂了一块牌子。所以也不是很久以前的事了

BR: Okay, so, this is Bill Ryan with Kerry Cassidy, and this is the 15th of October, 2009. And we are... what are you trying to say? 比尔・莱恩：这是比尔・莱恩和凯莉・卡西迪，这是 2009 年 10 月 15 日。我们是... 你想说什么？

KC: [laughs] Start again and say, ‘Project Camelot. Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot.’ (笑) 重新开始，然后说，‘卡米洛特计划，来自卡米洛特计划的比尔・瑞恩和凯瑞・卡西迪。’

BR: Okay. Did I not say that? 比尔：好吧，我没说过吗？

KC: No, you didn’t. 不，你没有

BR: Okay. All right. 比尔：好的，好的

KC: Go ahead. KC: 说吧

BR: Start again. This is Bill Ryan here with Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot, and it’s the 15th of October, 2009, and we have just come in from trudging around in the deep snow, to my amazement. On the 15th of October we shouldn’t be having weather like this, but for some reason we do. 比尔：重新开始。我是比尔・瑞恩，和卡米洛特计划的凯瑞・卡西迪在一起，今天是 2009 年 10 月 15 日，我们刚刚结束在深雪中的跋涉，让我惊讶不已。在 10 月 15 日，我们不应该有这样的天气，但出于某种原因，我们有

And it’s my personal delight and ours, I think, to be with Igor Witkowski, who is a Polish researcher. He speaks excellent English. And he’s written a very wonderful book, the English title of which would be 和波兰研究员伊戈尔・威特科夫斯基在一起是我个人和我们的快乐。他英语说得很好。他写了一本很棒的书，英文书名是The Truth about the Wunderwaffe 关于 Wunderwaffe 的真相. And of course that’s a reference to the Luftwaffe which is the German Air Force. 。当然，这是一个参考德国空军是德国空军

And he is a military historian and a researcher, and a little bit of a modern archeologist, I would say, because what we’ve just been doing this morning is looking at some ruins and relics of some very interesting structures in the woods that may or may not have something to do with the fabled Nazi Bell, as it’s become known. 他是一位军事历史学家和研究人员，也算是一位现代考古学家，我想说，因为我们今天早上所做的工作，就是在树林里寻找一些非常有趣的建筑遗迹和遗迹，这些遗迹可能和传说中的纳粹钟有关，也可能不是

And in this interview, I’m going to talk with Igor about his research, his interest in this topic, the conclusions that he’s drawn, some of the other things that he would like to tell us about which we don’t have the opportunity to visit or check out in person. And Igor, welcome. 在这次采访中，我将和伊戈尔谈谈他的研究，他对这个话题的兴趣，他得出的结论，还有一些他想告诉我们的其他事情，我们没有机会亲自参观或查看。伊戈尔，欢迎你

Igor Witkowski (IW): My pleasure. 伊戈尔・维特科夫斯基 (IW) : 我的荣幸

BR: And for the benefit of the people who are not familiar with your work, can you give a little introduction to yourself? How come you came to be interested in this topic? And you’re a pioneer, to some degree, of studying the possibility – in your view, I believe, the strong possibility – of advanced Nazi technology that most people do not recognize ever existed. When you first came across the Bell, was that in written documentation, or was that in witness testimony, and was it called the ‘Bell’? In the German I think it’s called ‘die Glocke.’ 比尔：为了那些对你的工作不熟悉的人的利益，你能给自己做一个小小的介绍吗？你怎么会对这个话题感兴趣？在某种程度上，你是研究先进纳粹技术可能性的先驱者，在你看来，我相信，这种可能性很大，而大多数人都不认识这种先进纳粹技术的存在。当你第一次看到贝尔的时候，是在书面文件中，还是在证人证词中，它被称为 “贝尔”？在德语里我想它叫做 die Glocke。’

IW: Yes, the Germans called it ‘die Glocke.’ The initial information was interrogation protocols of two Germans involved in the evacuation of the Bell. And there was no explanation what this device could be. It was known as the Bell, but it referred actually to the external appearance, because it resembled a bell to a large extent, being around ten feet high, three meters and one-and-a-half, up to two meters wide. It was my task to try to find some analogies to modern physics and try to unravel what it could be. 是的，德国人称之为 “die Glocke”。最初的信息是参与贝尔号撤退的两名德国人的审讯记录。没有人能解释这个装置是什么。它被称为 “钟”，但它实际上指的是外观，因为它在很大程度上类似于一个钟，大约 10 英尺高，3 米半，宽达 2 米。我的任务是试图找到一些现代物理学的类比，并试图弄清楚它可能是什么

BR: And what evidence were you working with? You knew that there was something called the Bell that was important enough to be part of a strategic evacuation at the close of the war, right? 比尔：你用的是什么证据？你知道有一种叫做贝尔的东西，它非常重要，足以在战争结束时成为战略撤退的一部分，对吗？

IW: Yes. IW: 是的

BR: And, what you were doing then, was you were putting together the puzzle from pieces of information that you collected. It started off with the interrogation protocols which you just mentioned, and there was something called the Bell but you didn’t know what it was. It was evidently important enough to be evacuated as part of a major strategic evacuation, as I understand it, towards the end of the war. Where did you go from there? 比尔：那时你在做的，就是把你收集到的信息碎片拼成拼图。一开始是你刚才提到的审讯程序，有一个叫贝尔的东西，但你不知道它是什么。据我所知，在战争即将结束的时候，作为主要战略撤离的一部分，撤离显然是非常重要的。你从那里去了哪里？

IW: Exactly, and it was stated in the original materials that it was the most secret research project of the Third Reich carried out during the entire war, and that was so amazing, so unusual, that I, first and foremost, I tried to verify such a claim. Was it possible for such a project involving such a strange device to exist? 伊恩・沃克：没错，而且在最初的材料中，这是第三帝国在整个战争期间进行的最机密的研究项目，这是如此令人惊讶，如此不同寻常，以至于我，首先，我试图证实这样的说法。这样一个涉及如此奇怪设备的项目是否可能存在？

And I have managed to find seven documents confirming that such a project which was officially code-named ‘Kriegsentscheide’ which means ‘decisive for the war,’ that such a project did exist, in fact. And itself, it’s a breakthrough in my opinion, because, nevertheless, it doesn’t fit any known existing pattern relating to weapons at all, to known German weapons from time of the war. 我还找到了七份文件，证实这样一个代号为 “Kriegsentscheide” 的项目确实存在，这个项目的官方代号是 “对战争起决定性作用”。在我看来，这本身就是一个突破，因为，尽管如此，它根本不符合任何已知的现有的与武器有关的模式，也不符合战争时期已知的德国武器

BR: Okay. Now, if this project was labeled as ‘Kriegsentscheiden’ – decisive for the war – but obviously it wasn’t decisive for the war because of the turn of events in history that we all know, this implied that this research project, if that’s what it was, was incomplete in some way. They made some progress, but they never finished what it was that they intended to start. 比尔：好的。现在，如果这个项目被标记为 “克里森特舍登”—— 对战争起决定性作用 —— 但显然它不是对战争起决定性作用的，因为我们都知道历史的转折，这意味着这个研究项目，如果是这样的话，在某种程度上是不完整的。他们取得了一些进展，但他们从未完成他们打算开始的事情

IW: Yes. It does seem so, that they didn’t manage to finish. I mean, the Germans didn’t finish the project. But such a classification as ‘decisive for the war’ had to be based on certain science, and that was the most fascinating, encouraging element of this puzzle. IW: 是的。看起来的确如此，他们没能完成。我的意思是，德国人没有完成这个项目。但是这种 “战争的决定性因素” 的分类必须基于某种科学，而这正是这个难题中最吸引人、最令人鼓舞的元素

It had to be something that could change the course of war, and I was trying to – based on my previous experience of military journalist and a historian – I was trying to develop this piece of the puzzle into a larger picture and to explain what it could have been, what generally could be imagined to change the course of war based on such a physical phenomena as has been described in this case, which were very strange, very unusual. 它必须是能够改变战争进程的东西，我试图 —— 基于我以前作为军事记者和历史学家的经验 —— 我试图把这个谜团发展成一个更大的图景，并解释它可能是什么，基于这个案例中所描述的物理现象，通常可以想象出什么来改变战争进程，这是非常奇怪、非常不寻常的

It was, frankly saying, when I heard about it for the first time, I mean, I heard about the physical and biological effects of this device, of the Bell’s operation. The first association that came to my mind, frankly saying, was the final sequence from the movie, Spielberg’s movie, 坦率地说，当我第一次听说它的时候，我的意思是，我听说了这个装置的物理和生物效应，贝尔的操作。坦率地说，我想到的第一个联想是电影的最后一个镜头，斯皮尔伯格的电影，The Raiders of the Lost Ark 夺宝奇兵, because it was something so amazing for the Germans themselves. 因为这对德国人自己来说是如此令人惊讶

So, it was, certainly it was worth verifying such a claim, anyway. 因此，无论如何，这种说法确实值得验证

BR: What was it that led you to understand that the physical evidence for the Bell was going to be in this particular location, because you came here and then you found a whole lot of other stuff, didn’t you? 比尔：是什么让你明白贝尔的物证将会在这个特定的地点，因为你来到这里，然后你发现了很多其他的东西，不是吗？

IW: Exactly. That was the case, and it was... there was some geographical names in this original German documents, I mean, interrogation protocols of these Germans. And among them, this area has been mentioned around Riese, which is the giant underground factory. And there was also a mention that a mine that has been turned over into a military research facility, that this mine was used for this research from December 1944, if I remember correctly. IW: 没错。是这样的，而且... 在这些德国原始文件中有一些地名，我的意思是，这些德国人的审讯记录。其中，这个地区在 Riese 周围被提到过，这是一个巨大的地下工厂。还有一个提到，一个地雷已经被转变为军事研究设施，如果我没记错的话，这个地雷从 1944 年 12 月开始就被用于这项研究

And first of all, I started to look for a mine which would be in the vicinity of the Waldenburg town, which is nearby, and I have found out that there is just only one mine in that area, and indeed it has been handed over to the military for military research and bears all the marks of such a complex. 首先，我开始寻找沃尔登堡附近的一个地雷，我发现那个地区只有一个地雷，事实上它已经交给军方用于军事研究，并且带有这样一个综合体的所有标志

BR: And, in the process then of coming here to check all that out, then you found this device which, or this structure, which has become known as ‘the Henge.’ I think... was that your term for it, or was that invented by Nick Cook who was the first westerner, or the first guy from America, let’s say... 比尔：在来这里检查的过程中，你发现了这个装置，或者说这个结构，被称为 “巨石阵”。“我想... ... 是你对它的称呼，还是尼克・库克发明的，他是第一个西方人，或者第一个来自美国的人，我们这么说吧... ..

IW: Mm-hm. IW: 嗯哼

BR: ...to come and check out this story based on the publication of your book. ‘The Henge,’ where did that come from, and what’s all that about?

IW: I wrote about it as the first, and the Henge has never been mentioned in the original document. It’s only my guess that it might have been used for such purposes. It’s based on certain similarity to the description of the testing environment of the Bell, that it has been tested in an underground chamber filled with water to some level, to certain level; in that place, resembling a pool, lined up with ceramic tiles and so on. IW: 我把它写成了第一本，而且在原始文件中从未提到过巨石柱。我只是猜测它可能被用于这种目的。它是基于对贝尔测试环境的描述的某种相似性，它已经在一个地下室中充满了一定水平的水，在那个地方，类似于一个池子，排列着瓷砖等等

So when I saw the pool around the Henge, it just, I just thought that it might have been used as a test rig for such a research, but it’s just a guess. The Henge in fact is not any proof of anything, and probably it wasn’t used for Germans, but, on the other hand, it doesn’t resemble any civilian construction as well. 所以当我看到巨石柱周围的水池时，我只是，我只是认为它可能被用作这样一个研究的试验装置，但它只是一个猜测。事实上，巨石柱并不能证明任何事情，也许它并不是用于德国人的，但是，另一方面，它也不像任何民用建筑

BR: Yes, we looked at that this morning, and I must admit, I was really struck by how enormous this structure is. It’s much, much larger than the measurements of the Bell which you just described. And if it is a test rig, it’s an enormous test rig. 比尔：是的，我们今天早上看过了，我必须承认，我真的被这个巨大的结构震惊了。它比你刚才描述的贝尔的尺寸大得多。如果这是一个测试装置，那么它就是一个巨大的测试装置

IW: Yes. Because I was writing earlier about various aviation and aerospace projects, I was familiar with such a kind of test rig which is called ‘flytrap’ unofficially. The first similarity or analogy that I saw, was that it resembled such a circular test rig. Therefore, I was... it has just brought to my mind the idea that it might have been such a test construction. But... IW: 是的。因为我早些时候写过关于各种航空和航天项目的文章，所以我很熟悉这种被非正式地称为 “捕蝇草” 的试验装置。我看到的第一个相似或类比，是它类似于这样一个圆形试验台。因此，我... ... 我突然想到，这可能是一个测试性的结构。但是..

KC: So are you saying the bottom photograph is the ‘flytrap’ and the top is the ‘Henge?’ 所以你是说下面的照片是捕蝇草，上面的是巨石柱

IW: Yes. The bottom photograph is the actual modern test rig, tested... used actually to test helicopters here in Poland. 是的。下面的照片是真实的现代试验台，经过测试... ... 实际上是用来在波兰测试直升机的

KC: Helicopters? 直升机？

IW: Yes, but it refers to any... 是的，但它指的是任何..

KC: Fascinating. IW: ...objects of taking off and landing vertically. It’s the same principle. 令人着迷。 IW: ... 垂直起飞和降落的物体。这是相同的原理

KC: Wow. KC: 哇

IW: And that was the analogy that... IW: 这是一个类比... ..

KC: It does look... it looks incredibly like... 看起来... 看起来难以置信的像..

IW: ...that struck me, and I was trying to explain it.

BR: Okay. And, now, what is your current theory, just to summarize all of this, because I know this is a complicated subject. But to summarize this, and also for people who are seeing this before our interview with Joseph Farrell. Joseph Farrell went into this in quite some detail on record with us. And to some degree, we can refer viewers to this video to that one. But what is your personal theory about exactly what they may have been doing? 比尔：好的。现在，你目前的理论是什么，来总结一下，因为我知道这是一个复杂的课题。总结一下，在我们采访约瑟夫・法雷尔之前，也有人看到了这一点。约瑟夫・法雷尔和我们一起对此进行了详细的记录。在某种程度上，我们可以把这个视频和那个视频联系起来。但是你个人对于他们到底在做什么的理论是什么？

IW: Evidently, on the basis of the original descriptions, the Bell was a kind of a plasma accelerator. Namely, there was high-voltage and high-intensity electric discharge inside such a... there were disks or drums inside, which were spinned in opposite directions around the same axis. And inside of them, there was some electric discharge of high voltage – around a million volts, as later on it came out from the documents – and it accelerated heavy ions, namely mercury, mercuric ions. And it generated very strong magnetic field and various strange effects. And what I managed to relate it to, is that... sorry, I will say it again, okay? From some moment. 显然，根据最初的描述，贝尔是一种等离子体加速器。这种电极内部存在高电压、高强度的放电。. 里面有圆盘或鼓，它们绕着同一个轴朝相反的方向旋转。在它们里面，有一些高电压的放电 —— 大约 100 万伏特，这是后来从文件中得到的 —— 它加速了重离子，也就是汞，汞离子。它产生了非常强的磁场和各种奇怪的效应。我设法把它联系起来，就是... ... 对不起，我再说一遍，好吗？从某个时刻开始

It appears that the Bell created vortices of plasma, of mercury plasma, mercuric ions, moving with... spinning with very high speeds, and in this case, the analogy to certain modern research and physics is such that in such a device, one can achieve the speeds of the order of ten percent of the speed of sound. And the speeds of the ions, yes and... 看起来贝尔创造了等离子体的漩涡，水银等离子体，水银离子，以非常高的速度旋转，在这种情况下，与某些现代研究和物理学的类比是这样的，在这样的装置中，一个人可以达到声速的 10% 的速度。离子的速度，是的，还有..

BR: Ten percent of the speed of light? 比尔：光速的 10% ？

IW: Yes, in some laboratories in New Mexico such a research has been carried out. IW: 是的，在新墨西哥州的一些实验室已经进行了这样的研究

KC: But did you mean ten percent of the speed of sound or light? 但是你的意思是声速或光速的 10% 吗？

IW: Ten percent of the speed of light. 光速的百分之十

KC: I see, okay. 我明白了，好的

IW: And... IW: 还有..

KC: So could you say that sentence again? 你能再说一遍那句话吗？

IW: Yes. It seems quite clearly that the Bell was a kind of a plasma accelerator. Namely, it accelerated plasma, actually mercuric ions, up to very high speeds. And I could make a connection with modern such experiments in which enormous velocities are achieved on the order of ten percent of the speed of light, and therefore it created, the Bell created two vortices of plasma containing very high energy and generating very high, very strong magnetic fields, among other things. IW: 是的。很明显，贝尔是一种等离子加速器。也就是说，它加速了等离子体，实际上是汞离子，达到了非常高的速度。我可以将其与现代的这类实验联系起来，在这类实验中，大量的速度达到了光速的 10% ，因此，贝尔产生了两个等离子体漩涡，其中包含了非常高的能量，并产生了非常高、非常强的磁场等等

And recently, new documents have surfaced, saying that – original German documents – saying that in one of the institutions affiliated with this research project – namely the research in institute of the AG Consortium – such a research has been in fact carried out during the war, and there is a clear link to gravity. Namely, it has been written in the documents by one of the participants of this project that what they were... excuse me. 最近出现了新的文件，其中说，原始的德国文件说，在这个研究项目的一个附属机构，即 AG 协会研究所，这种研究实际上是在战争期间进行的，而且与重力有明显的联系。也就是说，这个项目的一个参与者在文件中写道，他们是... ... 对不起

It has been written in a document by one of the participants in this research project that, among other things, they measured the velocity of the propagation of gravity, and other things. Also, it has been confirmed in a document that they observed very strange physical effects such as decaying of structures, decaying of neutrons, for example. Therefore, such a connection can be made. 这个研究项目的一个参与者在一份文件中写道，除了其他事情，他们还测量了重力传播的速度和其他事情。此外，他们在一份文件中证实，他们观察到非常奇怪的物理效应，例如结构的衰变，中子的衰变。因此，可以建立这样的连接

Further on, I was able to connect it exactly, or develop this thread relating to gravity, develop this aspect, gravitational aspect, of this device. One indication that the Bell was related to gravity research was the document from the, actually from American archives from the Paperclip files, saying that there was a link between a certain project carried out in the AG research institute, which participated in this project, that there is certain link with gravity. 进一步，我能够精确地连接它，或者发展这个与重力有关的线索，发展这个方面，这个装置的重力方面。贝尔与重力研究有关的一个迹象是，来自美国档案馆 Paperclip 文件的文件，文件称 AG 研究所开展的某个项目与重力有某种联系，该研究所参与了该项目

Other indication that it was gravity-related comes from the documents relating to pre-war activity of a scientist named Professor Walter Gerlach, who was one of the leading scientists of the Third Reich, by the way. And he tried to make such a link before the war. He carried out experiments with mercury, and there is scientific publications, papers about it, and it can be verified. 另一个与重力有关的迹象来自于一个名叫沃尔特・格拉赫教授的科学家的战前活动文件，他是第三帝国的主要科学家之一。他在战前就试图把这种联系起来。他进行了汞的实验，有科学出版物，关于它的论文，它可以被证实

And all this, all such elements created a certain comprehensive picture saying that the Bell was generating a very peculiar special kind of vortices, which display gravitational physical effects. Such a vortices [are] called ‘solitons.’ It’s a kind of vortex which is isolated from external fields, generally. First and foremost, the magnetic field in such a vortex is isolated from external magnetic or electromagnetic fields. It’s completely isolated. It’s like with superconductors or superliquidity. And they actually made such a... were making such a connections and it is known. 所有这一切，所有这些元素创造了一个特定的综合图景，说明贝尔正在产生一种非常特殊的漩涡，这种漩涡显示了引力物理效应。这种涡旋称为 “孤子”。这是一种通常独立于外部磁场的涡流。首先，这种涡旋中的磁场是与外部磁场或电磁场隔离的。它完全与世隔绝。就像超导体或者超流动性。他们实际上制造了这样一个。. 正在建立这样的联系，而且众所周知

And such a vortex should have generate strong anti-gravitational field. It’s based only on theoretical predictions, based on Einstein’s theory, but I’m not aware of any specific experiment of the same kind that would test the same circumstances or the same situation which the Bell was testing. I am not aware of such an experiment. 这样的涡旋应该会产生强烈的反重力场。它只是基于理论预测，基于爱因斯坦的理论，但是我不知道有任何具体的实验能够测试贝尔实验测试的相同环境或相同情况。我不知道有这样的实验

But what I can say is that there is a lot of theoretical predictions presently which say that it should generate gravitation, such a plasma vortex should generate a gravitational field. And let me show you something. There is a whole, there are entire books exploring this subject, this subject of gravity-related plasma research. And I didn’t take this book actually with me, but it... Sorry. May I? 但我能说的是，目前有很多理论预测认为它应该产生引力，这样的等离子涡应该产生引力场。我给你看样东西。有一个整体，有整个书籍探索这个主题，这个主题的重力相关的等离子体的研究。实际上我并没有把这本书带在身边，但是它... ... 对不起。可以吗？

KC: That’s fine. 没关系

BR: Yes, of course, of course. 比尔：是的，当然，当然

IW: Because it substantiates, you know, claim. I don’t remember where it is. Here. Here is the cover of the book. I will say it again. Actually there is a lot of... no. Once again. I didn’t manage to find any description of a modern experiment of exactly the same kind that was carried out in the Bell or by the Bell. But there is a lot of theoretical predictions by scientists which say that such a vortices, named ‘solitons,’ should generate gravitational or anti-gravitational fields. And there is a cover here of one of such a books, which is dedicated to this problem. The problem is, however, such that these are only the theoretical predictions. IW: 因为它证实了，你知道，声称。我不记得在哪儿了。给你。这是这本书的封面。我再说一遍。实际上有很多... 不。又一次。我没能找到任何描述一个完全相同的现代实验进行了在贝尔或贝尔。但是，科学家们有很多理论预测说，这种被称为 “孤子” 的漩涡应该会产生引力场或反引力场。这里有一本这样的书的封面，就是关于这个问题的。然而，问题在于，这些只是理论上的预测

Nobody has made or reproduced such a device and tried to check it out, and it’s a certain quite interesting phenomenon, because in fact what the Germans were trying to do with the Bell was to explore quantum approach to gravity. Because if you have ions spinning, moving, generating fields, it’s very hard to predict or calculate gravitational effect of quantum phenomena. It’s virtually impossible. 没有人制造或复制这样的装置并试图检验它，这是一个相当有趣的现象，因为事实上德国人试图用贝尔来做的是探索引力的量子方法。因为如果有离子在旋转，运动，产生场，就很难预测或计算量子现象的引力效应。这几乎是不可能的

And that’s the reason why it’s on the margin, this entire field which the Germans tried to explore, is on the margin of the modern physics, because it doesn’t fit. Once you have a quantum theory on gravity, there is a confirmation in modern physics, in modern science, that the German approach that I have described, related to the Bell, makes sense. 这就是为什么它处于边缘，这整个德国人试图探索的领域，处于现代物理学的边缘，因为它不适合。一旦你有了一个关于引力的量子理论，在现代物理学中，在现代科学中，有一个确认，那就是我所描述的德国方法，与贝尔理论有关，是有意义的

But it’s very difficult, if not almost impossible, to calculate precisely any force [that] are generated by such device. Because it’s generally gravity generated as a byproduct of quantum effect. And the Einstein theory doesn’t allow such a connection to be made. It just doesn’t see quantum physics, these are two different worlds. So, what the German represented would, excuse me... no, that’s it... about it. 但要精确计算这种装置产生的任何力，即使不是几乎不可能，也是非常困难的。因为引力通常是量子效应的副产品。爱因斯坦理论不允许这样的联系。它只是没有看到量子物理学，这是两个不同的世界。所以，德国人所代表的是，对不起... 不，就是这样... 关于它

KC: Okay, but are you saying this anti-gravitational field, that might be created within the Bell-like structure or the Henge-structure, are you saying this would allow, say, if it wasn’t a helicopter, let’s say even a disk to levitate... is that what they might have been doing, levitating? 好的，但是你是说这个反引力场，可能是在贝尔结构或者巨石结构中产生的，你是说这个可以，比如说，如果它不是一架直升机，我们甚至可以说是一个圆盘来悬浮... 这就是他们可能做的，悬浮？

IW: The problem with the Bell, among others, is such that clearly it was, or was supposed to be, a part of something larger. And I just don’t know the part of what, and nobody knows. And as far as the Henge is concerned, I was just... it was my, you know, free assumption, that there might have been something larger, some flying object, of which the Bell was a part. But I really don’t know that. IW: 在众多问题中，贝尔的问题是，它显然是，或者应该是，更大的东西的一部分。我只是不知道那部分是什么，没有人知道。至于巨石阵，我只是... ... 这是我的，你知道的，自由的假设，可能有一些更大的东西，一些飞行物体，贝尔是其中的一部分。但我真的不知道

BR: Now, many people watching this video will be familiar with the research that’s been done through documents and photographs – some of which looked to me to be pretty real – of German flying disks in, I think, it’s the Haunebu series. 比尔：现在，许多观看这个视频的人会熟悉通过文件和照片所做的研究 —— 其中一些在我看来是相当真实的 —— 德国飞碟，我认为，这是豪尼布系列

IW: Hm-mm. IW: 嗯

BR: Was it you who brought these to the public’s attention or was that another research? Because this is something, maybe, where we can maybe make a connection. 比尔：是你把这些引起了公众的注意，还是另一项研究？因为这也许是我们可以建立联系的地方

IW: I didn’t want to connect this story about the Bell with the so-called Nazi UFO legend, because I cannot check it out and what I did is generally based on verifiable facts, mostly, and makes sense. It can be connected to modern physics, and so on. So I just didn’t want to, you know, immerse myself into such a hazy stories like the Nazi UFO. Although I admit such a possibility, that the Bell could have been part of some larger flying object. But I didn’t write about it, because I just don’t know that, and I cannot check it out. 我不想把这个关于贝尔的故事和所谓的纳粹 UFO 传说联系起来，因为我不能证实它，而且我所做的一般都是基于可证实的事实，大部分都是有意义的。它可以和现代物理学联系起来，等等。所以我只是不想，你知道，沉浸在这样一个朦胧的故事像纳粹 UFO。虽然我承认这种可能性，但贝尔可能是某个较大飞行物的一部分。但是我没有写关于它的文章，因为我不知道这些，我也不能查出来

BR: Okay. Now, as a military historian particularly interested in what the Nazis may have been doing, you must have been interested to check out the information from other researchers who produced photographs and, I think, documents, with what look like blueprints. Are those photographs and documents authentic? Or do you just not know? Why is it that that doesn’t feel like compelling evidence to you? Cause it looks very dramatic. 比尔：好的。现在，作为一个对纳粹的所作所为特别感兴趣的军事历史学家，你一定有兴趣从其他研究人员那里获取信息，他们制作了照片，我认为还有文件，看起来像是蓝图。那些照片和文件是真的吗？或者你只是不知道？为什么你觉得这不像是令人信服的证据呢？因为它看起来非常戏剧化

IW: I am not sure if the so-called blueprints of the Nazi UFO’s look genuine. I just cannot check it out and therefore I... because I knew that I would not be able to check it out. I was not interested in this story. I don’t know that. I... 我不确定纳粹 UFO 的所谓蓝图看起来是否真实。我只是不能检查出来，因此我。. 因为我知道我不可能查出来。我对这个故事不感兴趣。我不知道。我。

KC: So, but you’re saying, you found the Henge structure and it was painted with camouflage, isn’t this true? 所以，你是说，你发现了巨石柱的结构，并且它被涂上了伪装色，这不是真的吗？

IW: Yes, the so-called Henge is a... looks like a finished structure and in the case of a supporting structure for a cooling tower, it would be completely inside the cooling tower, which is generally filled with very hot water-vapor. And such a green camouflage paint on the plaster, it wouldn’t make sense, just because, anyway, it would be hidden inside of a larger structure. So it just didn’t seem to me to be part of such a cooling tower. IW: 是的，所谓的 “巨石柱” 是一个。. 看起来像一个完成的结构，在冷却塔的支撑结构的情况下，它会完全在冷却塔内部，通常充满了非常热的水蒸气。而这种绿色的伪装涂料在石膏上，是没有意义的，因为，无论如何，它会隐藏在一个更大的结构里面。所以在我看来，它不像是这样一个冷却塔的一部分

One more fact, suggesting that it wasn’t to be a supporting structure for a cooling tower; is that there are no foundations underneath the Henge, to support something that large. Because it would have to be some 13 stories high. There are no foundations for such a thing. 另一个事实是，它不是一个冷却塔的支撑结构，而是在巨石柱下面没有地基来支撑那么大的东西。因为它必须有 13 层楼高。这种事情是没有根据的

One question that arose in my mind, when I was trying to research or investigate the physical aspect of the Bell, was that... the question whether it was in Germany, in the third Reich, any physical theory that would allow to perceive, at all, vortices of plasma as sources of gravity. And to my amazement, I have found one. There was a German professor named Pascual Jordan, who has developed such a theory during the war and still is almost unknown. But it was the first physical theory that treated vortices as sources of gravity. 当我试图研究或调查贝尔的物理方面时，我脑海中出现了一个问题，那就是... ... 这个问题是否在德国，在第三帝国，是否有任何物理理论允许我们感知等离子体的漩涡作为引力的来源。令我惊讶的是，我找到了一个。有一位名叫帕斯夸尔・乔丹的德国教授，他在战争期间发展出了这样一个理论，至今仍然鲜为人知。但这是第一个将涡旋视为重力源的物理学理论

That’s a piece of the puzzle that convinced me that it all makes sense. And in fact, I have a co-worker who is a scientist specializing in this field, and for him it also makes sense. So it’s not any pure fantasy or something. It’s a real scientific challenge to this day. 这是让我确信这一切都有意义的谜团的一部分。事实上，我有一个同事，他是专门研究这个领域的科学家，对他来说，这也是有意义的。所以这不是纯粹的幻想或什么的。时至今日，这仍然是一个真正的科学挑战

BR: Sure. I must say what interests me about this, is that if we take that sort of logical line of deduction, which you have been presenting, that there seems to be an experimenting with some advanced practical technical way of creating an anti-gravity effect – it really does look like that – and if this was a war-decisive technology, the next stage in the logic is that they are trying to get something to fly in an advanced means of flying propulsion. 比尔：当然。我必须说我对此感兴趣的是，如果我们采用你们一直提出的那种逻辑推理方法，似乎有一种先进的实用技术方法来实验创造反重力效果 —— 它看起来确实是这样的 —— 如果这是一种决定战争的技术，逻辑的下一阶段是，他们正在尝试用先进的飞行推进手段来飞行某种东西

And so I can’t help, then, but take that logic to the fact that they were trying to get something to fly that might have been a disk-shaped object. And a disk-shaped object is perfect to have something rotating inside, some rotating plasma-effect. It does seem to fit with some of these stories, rumors, photographs, documents, that we’ve seen, showing the apparent existence of a very primitive sort of flying-disk. But ... it just interests me that you don’t feel that you can go there, because there’s no evidence. I mean those photographs look real to me. 所以我不能帮忙，但是把这个逻辑应用到他们试图让某个东西飞起来的事实上，那可能是一个圆盘状的物体。圆盘状的物体最适合内部有旋转的东西，一些旋转的等离子体效应。它似乎与我们看到的一些故事，谣言，照片，文件相吻合，显示了一种非常原始的飞碟的存在。但是... 我只是对你感兴趣，你觉得你不能去那里，因为没有证据。我的意思是那些照片看起来很真实

IW: Yes, but looking at such a photographs of the so called Nazi UFO’s wouldn’t contribute to my research at all. Because they don’t convey any substantial information and it wouldn’t, you know, there is nothing... there’s no entry to any new field in this way. 是的，但是看这些所谓的纳粹不明飞行物的照片对我的研究毫无帮助。因为它们没有传达任何实质性的信息，而且也不会，你知道，没有什么... 没有任何新领域的入口

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

IW: You said a very interesting and good thing, that connecting this with a war-decisive, because it would be such a breakthrough. IW: 你说了一件很有趣也很好的事情，把这个和一场决定性的战争联系起来，因为这将是一个很大的突破

BR: Now, just looking again at the fact that we know that this was a war... it was labeled as a war- decisive project. And it seems to have had something to do with anti-gravity effects. At that time there were some cutting-edge physics involved. There are some very smart people involved in this project. And clearly, the Nazi’s put a lot of resources behind this and labeled it at the highest level of secrecy they had. What is your personal idea about what this could have been used for? 比尔：现在，我们再来看看这个事实，我们知道这是一场战争... ... 它被贴上了战争决定性项目的标签。这似乎与反重力效应有关。在那个时候，有一些尖端的物理学参与。有一些非常聪明的人参与了这个项目。很明显，纳粹投入了大量的资源，并将其标记为他们拥有的最高级别的秘密。你个人认为这个可以用来做什么？

IW: It might have been used as a part of strategic weapons. Namely as an element of the propulsion system and ... the scientist working with me on this, as a consultant, has once said that if they would master such a technology, indeed it would be a greater breakthrough than construct... than building a nuclear weapon. Because it would be [the] opening of the entire new area of physics, field of physics. And it would allow them to make a weapon, carrying chemical or nuclear warheads for example, or weapons, against which there would be no defense, as against the V2, there was no defense effectively. IW: 它可能被用作战略武器的一部分。也就是说，作为推进系统的一个组成部分，以及... ... 与我一起研究这个问题的科学家，作为一名顾问，曾经说过，如果他们能够掌握这样一种技术，那将是一个比建造核武器更大的突破... ..。因为这将开启物理学的全新领域，物理学的领域。它将允许他们制造一种武器，例如携带化学或核弹头，或者武器，对它们没有防御，就像 V2，没有有效的防御

And it would allow them, really, to conquer the world. And I believe that the war would be over very quickly, in such a case. One may say also that the Germans didn’t have nuclear weapons to exploit such a breakthrough, but they also had chemical weapons and they were, frankly saying, much more deadly and lethal. It was the newest generation of neuro-gases, so-called, which was so effective that they really could inflict major losses within a week or within a couple of days. And such a breakthrough certainly would be decisive for the war. So, therefore, also from this point of view it makes sense. 这将使他们，真的，征服世界。我相信在这种情况下，战争很快就会结束。也有人可能会说，德国人没有核武器来利用这样的突破，但他们也有化学武器，坦率地说，他们有更多的致命性和致命性。这是所谓的最新一代神经气体，非常有效，可以在一周或几天内造成重大损失。这样的突破对于这场战争来说无疑是决定性的。因此，从这个角度来看，也是有道理的

BR: Now... 比尔：现在... ..

KC: Okay... 好的

IW: Sorry. IW: 对不起

KC: I have to say that I don’t understand how the anti-gravity... how does that link up with the delivery system? 我不得不说，我不明白反重力是如何与传输系统连接起来的？

IW: Uh-huh. IW: 嗯

KC: How is that... if it’s not an UFO, what is it? 那是怎么回事... 如果不是 UFO，那是什么？

IW: Such a breakthrough in physics, in mastering gravity, would enable the Germans to make a kind of platform object, flying object, against which there would be no defense, which would be able to reach any corner of the world and deliver the most destructive, lethal weapons that they had. Perhaps the Germans didn’t have the nuclear weapons, but they also had a very destructive chemical arsenal incomparable, in every respect, with the allied chemical or biological arsenals. It would be very deadly, and such a weapon that would enable them to deliver these weapons of mass-destruction to the major cities of the United States, for example, would certainly be decisive for the war and the losses would, on the allied side, would rise in such a dramatic, at such a dramatic pace, that probably it would end the war. 伊恩・沃克：物理学上的这种突破，在掌握重力方面，将使德国人能够制造一种平台物体，飞行物体，对其无防御，能够到达世界的任何一个角落，并发射他们所拥有的最具破坏性的致命武器。也许德国没有核武器，但是他们也有一个非常具有破坏性的化学武器库，在各个方面都无法与盟国的化学或生物武器库相比。这将是非常致命的，例如，这种武器将使他们能够把这些大规模毁灭性武器运送到美国的主要城市，这种武器肯定对战争具有决定性意义，而盟国方面的损失将以如此戏剧性的速度增加，可能会结束战争

BR: Now, let me ask you about nuclear weapons, because Joseph Farrell and I think also Jim Marrs, and they’re both pretty good researchers, they believe that the Nazis may have been on the verge of developing a workable nuclear weapon. In your opinion, is this possible? 比尔：现在，让我来问问你们关于核武器的问题，因为约瑟夫・法雷尔和我认为吉姆・马尔斯也是，他们都是非常优秀的研究人员，他们相信纳粹可能已经处于，发展可用的核武器的边缘。在你看来，这可能吗？

IW: The Germans were much closer to manufacturing nuclear weapons than is generally thought. And I personally have recovered several documents from various archives, saying that, describing, for example, places where the nuclear weapons were actually manufactured, or revealing completely new segments of the German nuclear program, if there was such, by the way, because it was so... it is called compartmentalization. To divide various elements so that there is no, I would say, horizontal connection, between them. And they don’t know about each other. IW: 德国制造核武器的可能性比人们通常认为的要大得多。我个人已经从各种档案中恢复了一些文件，说，例如，描述核武器实际制造的地方，或者揭示德国核计划的全新部分，如果有这样的，顺便说一下，因为它是如此... 它被称为防火分区。把不同的元素分开，这样它们之间就没有水平的联系了。他们彼此都不了解对方

I have personally recovered many such documents, saying that the German nuclear program was far more advanced than was previously thought, especially in the West, mostly because this facilities were located in the so-called latter Eastern zone. Therefore the Allied, the intelligence services of the Western allies didn’t have any access to them. They were located here, in the lower Silesia in the Czech Republic which was nicknamed by Hitler himself as the SS dukedom. 我个人找到了许多这样的文件，说德国的核项目比我们以前想象的要先进得多，特别是在西方，主要是因为这些设施位于所谓的东方后区。因此，同盟国，西方同盟国的情报部门无法接触到他们。他们就坐落在这里，位于捷克共和国的下西里西亚，希特勒亲自戏称这里为党卫军公国

And the Western researchers never had any idea about it. Apart from the valley with the Henge, there is the Riese facility, which was supposed to be the second largest underground armament complex of the Third Reich. And we, in fact, are in the middle of it, I mean very close to it. And it was supposed to serve as a final production assembly line of... devoted to the project of the Bell. 而西方研究人员对此一无所知。除了有巨石阵的山谷之外，还有里斯设施，它被认为是第三帝国第二大的地下军事基地。事实上，我们正处于其中，我的意思是非常接近。它被认为是作为最后的生产流水线... ... 专门的项目贝尔

Therefore, one may draw a conclusion that the Bell was supposed to be part of a larger weapon that was supposed to be produced here, manufactured here. And although the Riese was supposed to be the second largest underground facility in the Third Reich, it was also a small fragment of a much larger complex. I have recovered documents about it, signed by Kammler, by General Kammler himself, which says that the Riese was part of a, as they called it, a S3 Special Construction and Undertaking. In German it was Sonderbauvorhaben S-Drei. 因此，人们可以得出结论，贝尔应该是一个更大的武器的一部分，应该在这里生产，在这里制造。虽然里斯被认为是第三帝国第二大的地下设施，但它也只是一个更大的复合体的一小部分。我已经恢复了一些文件，是由 Kammler 将军亲自签署的，上面写着 Riese 是一个，他们称之为，s 3 特殊建筑和承包项目的一部分。德语是 Sonderbauvorhaben S-Drei

And the document signed by General Kammler himself says that it was the largest SS project of the entire war. And it’s... it could have been some equivalent of the American Manhattan Project, because there was a connection between the means of carrying systems for the weapons of mass-destruction, perhaps involving the Bell, and the weapons of mass-destruction themselves. One of the prisoners working here has mentioned that there was a clear connection between this facility and the chemical arsenal. 由 Kammler 将军亲自签署的文件称这是整个战争中最大的党卫军项目。这可能和美国曼哈顿计划差不多，因为运载大规模杀伤性武器系统的方法，也许和贝尔有关，和大规模杀伤性武器本身之间有联系。在这里工作的一名囚犯提到，这个设施与化学武器库之间有明显的联系

On the other hand, there is a scientist researcher who worked for the government, in the early sixties, [who] has found remnants of some radioactive substances. I could personally mention a couple of names of people who died because of radioactivity here. And... 另一方面，在 60 年代早期，有一位为政府工作的科学家研究员，他发现了一些放射性物质的残留物。我个人可以提到几个因辐射而死的人的名字。还有..

KC: When you say ‘here,’ where exactly do you mean? Could you show us on the map, what area we’re talking about? 当你说 “这里” 的时候，你到底是什么意思？你能在地图上指给我们看吗，我们说的是哪个地区？

IW: Yes, I can show you on the map. IW: 是的，我可以在地图上指给你看

BR: Yeah. 比尔：是的

IW: This is a map showing only the mountain massive in which the Riese complex has been excavated. And there are specific facilities, such as here, here, underground facilities, here, here... A lot of them, around the entire massive. IW: 这是一张地图，只显示了里斯复合体被挖掘出来的大量山体。还有一些特殊的设施，比如这里，这里，地下设施，这里，这里... ... 很多这样的设施，围绕着整个巨大的建筑

And along with that, there was also infrastructure for such a construction site, such as sitings of a narrow gauge railway here, sub-camps of the concentration camp, barracks of the SS, in various places around there was around 40,000 people, 40-50,000 people working on it, for a couple of years. 除此之外，还有一些建筑工地的基础设施，比如这里的一条窄轨铁路，集中营的分营，党卫军的营房，周围各个地方大约有 4 万人，4 万到 5 万人在这里工作了几年

KC: Where was the Henge in reference to this map? 根据这张地图，巨石阵在哪里？

IW: The Henge, in reference to this, is some five kilometers to the south. It’s out of the map. Riese, the underground facility, is inside of the mountain massive, under the entire mountain massive, and on the other side of this massive, there was a set of bunkers, much like in the... near the Henge itself, only that they were located mostly underground. And camouflaged. IW: 这里所说的巨石阵，大约在南面五公里的地方。这超出了地图的范围。里斯，地下设施，位于山体之内，在整座山体之下，在这个巨大的山体的另一边，有一组掩体，很像在... ... 靠近巨石阵本身，只不过它们大部分位于地下。还有伪装

And in one of such a bunker, supposedly, three people found a substance resembling mercury, only that it was denser. And all of them died of leukemia and cancer, and such a things. And I knew one of them and I can say that... it’s just a fact. 据推测，在这样一个掩体中，有三个人发现了一种类似水银的物质，只不过密度更大。他们都死于白血病和癌症，诸如此类。我认识他们中的一个，我可以说... 这是事实

BR: Is that substance, or is it possible that that substance, is what has been referred to in documents – and you may need to remind me here – is called ‘Serum 525,’ I think it, have I got that right? 比尔：那种物质，或者那种物质，有没有可能，就是文件中提到的东西 —— 你可能需要提醒我一下 —— 叫做 “525 血清”，我想是的，我说对了吗？

IW: I know people that were killed, I am only not sure what killed them. IW: 我知道有人被杀了，我只是不确定是什么杀了他们

BR: Mm-hm. 比尔：嗯

IW: But... because they died of leukemia, various forms of cancer, it seems likely to me, they described it, when they lived here, they described the substance as something resembling mercury, only that it was something jelly-like, not entirely liquid... IW: 但是... ... 因为他们死于白血病，各种各样的癌症，在我看来，他们这样描述它，当他们住在这里的时候，他们描述这种物质是类似汞的东西，只是说它是某种胶状物质，不完全是液体... ..

BR: Hmm. 比尔：嗯

IW: ...such a strange state of matter. And it reminded me of the substance that was supposedly placed inside the Bell, in the core of the Bell, not in the cylinders that was [were] spinned, which was code-named ‘serum’ or ‘serum 525.’

BR: Mm-hm. 比尔：嗯

IW: And, just from the description, it just seemed something similar, but I am not sure because I didn’t see it. IW: 而且，仅从描述来看，它似乎有些相似，但我不确定，因为我没有看到它

BR: Did they say what color it was? 比尔：他们有说是什么颜色吗？

IW: They didn’t. 他们没有

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

IW: They didn’t. 他们没有

BR: What really interests me, about this, because this is all a big detective story that you are putting together here, is that it was the singlemost... it was the largest SS project in the war and yet we know almost nothing about it. I mean that’s really quite a big clue in itself as to its importance. And as you said, the level of secrecy like the Nazi-equivalent to the Manhattan Project. That’s fascinating. 比尔：真正让我感兴趣的是，因为这是你们整理出来的一个大型侦探故事，它是最单一的... ... 它是战争中最大的党卫军项目，但我们对它几乎一无所知。我的意思是，这本身就是一个非常重要的线索。就像你说的，保密程度就像纳粹的曼哈顿计划。真有意思

IW: Yes, it is indeed fascinating, but we should bear in mind that the SS had certain advantages for them, namely that they had, to a large extent, they had their own financing. They didn’t have to report to any external institutions outside, I mean outside the empire. The most significant advantage of the SS, from the point of view of the Third Reich itself, was that they had their own workforce in the form of prisoners. 是的，这的确很吸引人，但是我们应该记住党卫军对他们有一定的优势，也就是说，在很大程度上，他们有自己的资金。他们不必向任何外部机构报告，我指的是帝国之外。纳粹党卫军最大的优势，从第三帝国自身的角度来看，就是他们有自己的囚犯队伍

There was a specially-raised concentration camp, Gross-Rosen, here nearby, and such a prisoners were called by them as ‘Geheimnisträger’ which means somebody who is carrying literally the secret, which means that they were connected with the secret until forever and ever and ever. They couldn’t come out and say and tell anybody else, outside. So... 附近有一个特别设立的集中营，叫格罗斯 - 罗森，这样的囚犯被他们称为 “Geheimnisträger”，意思是有人真正地带着秘密，意思是他们与秘密有关，直到永永远远。他们不能出来告诉外面的任何人。所以..

KC: But were there any survivors? 但是有幸存者吗？

IW: Yes, it’s a very good question. None of the over 20,000 prisoners working in the finished central section of the Riese has survived. One of the prisoners of the Gross-Rosen, who was a writer in the camp, has testified after the war to the special commission, that every day he has reported the number of prisoners, working, living every day, to the people from the SS. And one day he has told them that, ‘Sirs, there must have been some mistake, because the number has changed by over 20,000.’ And they smiled and told him that, ‘No, there is no mistake, it’s okay.’ IW: 是的，这是一个很好的问题。在已完工的黎塞中央区工作的 20000 多名囚犯无一生还。格罗斯 - 罗森集中营的一名囚犯是一名作家，他在战后向特别委员会作证说，他每天都向纳粹党卫军报告囚犯的人数，每天工作，每天生活。有一天，他告诉他们，‘先生们，一定是弄错了，因为这个数字已经变了 2 万多。他们笑着告诉他，“不，没有错，没关系。”

BR: That’s really sinister, isn’t it? That’s so... yeah... 比尔：那真的很险恶，不是吗？那真是... 是的..

IW: Yes. And probably they have been closed inside this facility, the central section of the Riese. 伊恩・沃克：是的。很可能他们已经被关在这个设施里了，里斯河的中心部分

BR: What you are really saying here, then, which is something that many people in the modern world might not fully understand, is that the SS, they had their own financing, they had their own resources, they had their own workforce, they were insulated from the rest of the Nazi party and, basically, they could do anything they wanted to. And they had really no controls over them whatsoever, is that right? 比尔：那么，你在这里真正要说的是，现代世界的很多人可能不完全理解的是，纳粹党卫军，他们有自己的资金，他们有自己的资源，他们有自己的劳动力，他们与纳粹党的其他成员隔绝，基本上，他们可以做任何他们想做的事情。他们真的没有控制它们，对吗？

IW: That’s exactly true, because the Third Reich has occupied many countries and they used various or employed various companies, forced laborers from various countries. And normally it was quite hard to keep something secret, especially involving tens of thousands of people. And the SS was the only solution to such a problem, because they could solve this. 伊恩・沃克：的确是这样，因为第三帝国占领了许多国家，他们利用各种各样的公司或雇佣各种各样的公司，从各个国家强迫劳工。通常情况下，保守秘密是很困难的，特别是涉及到成千上万的人。党卫军是解决这个问题的唯一方法，因为他们可以解决这个问题

BR: Okay. Yeah, I understand. 比尔：好的，是的，我明白

KC: Okay, but... I think... What, where were these... you said there is a camp nearby here? 好的，但是... ... 我想... ... 什么，这些在哪里... ... 你说这附近有个营地？

IW: Yes... 是的... ..

KC: And... 还有..

IW: ...the Gross-Rosen concentration camp.

KC: I see. And is it known, is the location known? 我明白了。那么是否已知，地点是否已知？

IW: The location is known, but the only... really the only part that was left, is a gate and some foundations for the barracks. Because it wasn’t a concentration camp like Auschwitz, for example, which was a mass extermination camp. It was, in this case, the camp Gross-Rosen was really only a distribution center for the workforce. And the prisoners didn’t stay there for long. They could stay for a week or something, but not for long. And the entire workforce, all the prisoners worked in sub-camps... 伊恩・沃克：地点已经知道了，但是唯一剩下的部分是一个大门和一些兵营的地基。因为它不是像奥斯维辛集中营那样的集中营，比如说，奥斯维辛集中营是一个集体灭绝营。在这种情况下，格罗斯 - 罗森营实际上只是一个劳动力的分配中心。囚犯们没有在那里呆多久。他们可以呆上一个星期或者别的什么，但是不会太久。所有的劳动者，所有的囚犯都在分支集中营工作

BR: Mmh. 比尔：嗯

IW: ...attached to specific undertakings. 国际工会: ... 附属于具体事业

BR: It’s like a temporary holding camp. 比尔：就像一个临时的拘留营

IW: Yes, just a distribution center. 是的，只是一个配送中心

KC: So, but where were the prisoners kept? 那么，那些囚犯被关在哪里？

IW: They were kept in wooden barracks mostly, some of them lived underground in the tunnels. There is a difference between the parts of the Riese that we know today, which contribute to some 80,000 cubic meters underground, and the German data from the time of the war. 他们大部分被关在木制的营房里，有些人住在地下的隧道里。我们今天所知道的里斯河部分地区，在地下有 8 万立方米的水量，与德国战争时期的数据是不同的

When the armament minister, for example, has stated, according to some report from September of 1944, that over 220,000 cubic meters was already made, underground, so there is some 150,000 cubic meters missing. 例如，当军备部长声称，根据 1944 年 9 月的一些报告，超过 220,000 立方米已经在地下生产，所以大约有 150,000 立方米不见了

And it’s certainly, I mean, everything indicates that it’s the central part of the massive, which holds the finished part, where the prisoners were working on something, manufacturing something, already before the end of the war. And probably they have been... the entrances have been blasted off, and they have been closed underground. 毫无疑问，我的意思是，一切都表明，这里是大规模行动的中心部分，这里保留着完工的部分，在战争结束之前，囚犯们在这里工作，制造一些东西。也许它们已经... ... 入口已经被炸掉了，它们已经被关闭在地下

BR: Would that have been part of the strategic evacuation? 比尔：那会是战略撤退的一部分吗？

IW: Yes, pretty much, probably the same office of the Reich’s central security office was dealing with that. And evacuations were just an extension of such measures, aimed at securing crucial potential, for the post-war period. IW: 是的，差不多，很可能就是帝国中央安全办公室处理这件事的部门。疏散只是这些措施的延伸，目的是为了确保战后时期的关键潜力

BR: When you were traveling here in the car, you used a term that I found most interesting, which was ‘strategic evacuation,’ and that indicated to me that this process of evacuating, to wherever they evacuated to and whatever they evacuated and whoever they evacuated, after the war, was something that was carefully planned. It was like a strategic withdrawal, it wasn’t just everyone running for the door. 比尔：当你开车来这里的时候，你用了一个我觉得最有趣的词，“战略撤退”，这个词告诉我，这个撤退的过程，到他们撤退到的任何地方，无论他们撤退到哪里，无论他们撤退到哪里，无论他们撤退到哪里，无论他们撤退到哪里，在战后，都是经过精心策划的。这就像是一次战略性的撤退，不仅仅是每个人都向门口跑去

It was something that was a carefully coordinated military plan. Now, when do you think that plan was established? How soon, before the formal end of the war, did they start to think, ‘You know what? We’re not going to make this through as was planned. We are going have to go to plan B.’ And what do you think that plan B was? This is something that is hugely interesting and of course, just to continue that question, for some people who suspect that many of the key Nazis and maybe much of the technology survived the war and was exported elsewhere, this is a really important question. 这是一个经过精心协调的军事计划。那么，你认为这个计划是什么时候制定的？战争还没有正式结束，他们多久就开始想，‘你知道吗？我们不能按计划进行了。我们必须执行 b 计划。’你认为 b 计划是什么？这是一件非常有趣的事情，当然，继续这个问题，对于一些人来说，他们怀疑许多关键的纳粹分子，也许许多技术幸存了下来，并被出口到其他地方，这是一个非常重要的问题

IW: The Germans were forced, initially, by the allied air raids, to develop a set of operations, aimed at securing the most crucial potential. Initially, just to prevent it from being destroyed by the allied bombs, but the extension of this operations were the so-called strategic evacuations, aimed at evacuating the most crucial resources, such as scientific heritage of the Third Reich, and so on, abroad. 德国人最初被盟军的空袭所迫，发展了一系列行动，旨在保护最关键的潜力。最初，只是为了防止它被盟军的炸弹摧毁，但这次行动的延伸是所谓的战略疏散，旨在疏散最重要的资源，如第三帝国的科学遗产，等等，国外

There was a set of deals signed with Japan and with Argentina, that was to facilitate such evacuations and in fact everything indicates that the Bell project was evacuated to Argentina and was continued for some time, because there is a clear connection and continuity. One of several, I mean not one, but several people, from the project, continued the work in Argentina. And they also mentioned later on about gravitational aspect of the plasma physics and so on. 与日本和阿根廷签署了一系列协议，以便利这种疏散，事实上，一切迹象表明，贝尔项目被疏散到阿根廷，并持续了一段时间，因为有明确的联系和连续性。其中一个，我指的不是一个，而是几个来自该项目的人，继续在阿根廷的工作。他们后来还提到了等离子体物理的引力方面等等

KC: So who were these people that were running this whole part of the SS... 那么这些党卫军的指挥官是谁..

IW: Evacuation. IW: 疏散

KC: Well, not just evacuation but also the Riese facility. Who were these people? 不仅仅是疏散，还有里斯的设施。这些人是谁？

IW: The institution responsible for this project involving Riese and the latter vicinity, which was code named S3, Special Construction Undertaking S3, was the Kammler’s office. It was called ‘SonderStaff,’ which means special staff for special undertakings related to armament production, the most state-of-the-art, involving the most state-of-the-art weapons. Sorry about. 国际工程师协会：负责这个涉及 Riese 和后者附近地区的项目的机构代号为 s 3，特别建筑承包 s 3，是 Kammler 的办公室。它被称为 “SonderStaff”，意思是负责与军备生产有关的特殊事业的特别工作人员，这是最先进的技术，涉及最先进的武器。对不起

KC: Okay, but... so it was Himmler, you’re saying. [Ed. Note: Igor Witkowski was referring to 好吧，但是... ... 你是说是希姆莱干的。[艾德。注意：伊戈尔・维特科夫斯基指的是Hans Kammler 汉斯・卡姆勒]

IW: Yes, the SS generally. 是的，党卫军一般

KC: Yeah, but who particularly from the SS when you say they also continued their work in South America? What, who are we talking about? 是的，但是当你说党卫军也继续在南美工作的时候，是谁特别喜欢他们呢？什么，我们说的是谁？

KC: The SS was coordinating the research, the project, as such, but wasn’t involved in the research. There were no scientists in it, so... 党卫军负责协调研究，项目本身，但是没有参与研究。里面没有科学家所以..

KC: Who was involved? Do we know the names of anybody? 参与者是谁？我们知道谁的名字吗？

IW: Yes, we do. The most important was Professor Walter Gerlach who was responsible for the physical aspect of this project. The project was code named Chronos/Laterned Trigger. The one code name referred to the physical aspect of it. The other one referred to medical or biological aspect. And it is not certain which one referred to which one, but the project was code named Chronos. [Ed. Note: further research and discussions about the Bell, who was involved, and code names can be found IW: 是的。最重要的是沃尔特・格拉赫教授，他负责这个项目的物理方面。这个项目的代号是 Chronos/Laterned Trigger。其中一个代号指的是它的物理方面。另一个涉及医学或生物学方面。我们不能确定是哪一个指的是哪一个，但是这个项目的代号是克罗诺斯。[教育署]。注：关于贝尔的进一步研究和讨论，谁参与了，代码名称可以找到here] 这里

BR: Which means time. 比尔：意思是时间

IW: It doesn’t mean time exactly. It means a Greek god... IW: 并不完全是指时间，它的意思是希腊神..

KC: Yes, it is a god. 是的，它是一个神

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

KC: And he was the god... 他是上帝..

IW: ...who gave people something.

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

IW: I don’t remember now ... but it is a very interesting legend about it. I mean as far as Greek mythology is concerned. It is not time, as such. IW: 我现在不记得了... ... 但这是一个非常有趣的传说。我的意思是就希腊神话而言。现在还不是时候

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

IW: It’s interesting. We are checking it out. The most important person was Professor Walter Gerlach in this project, who was responsible for the physical aspect of it. He researched on the spinning of mercuric ions, extensively before the war. Tried to connect it with the so-called isolated vortices which means solitons. It’s all verified, published and so on. IW: 这很有趣。我们正在调查。这个项目中最重要的人物是沃尔特・格拉赫教授，他负责项目的物理方面。战前，他对汞离子的旋转进行了广泛的研究。试图把它和孤立的涡旋联系起来，孤立的涡旋意味着孤子。这些都是经过验证、发布的，等等

The other person was SS Gruppenführer Ernst-Robert Grawitz. He was the only SS scientist in the team who was responsible for the medical and biological effects, aspect of this project and he was Chief of the Institute of Hygiene of the Waffen SS. But he committed suicide before the end of the war. 另一个人是党卫队队长恩斯特 - 罗伯特・格拉维茨。他是这个团队中唯一一个党卫军科学家，负责这个项目的医疗和生物效应方面，他还是党卫军卫生研究所所长。但是他在战争结束前自杀了

KC: What about Wernher von Braun? 沃纳・冯・布劳恩怎么样？

IW: There is no indication saying that Wernher von Braun or all the rocket scientists were involved in this project, except for one. There is one whose name was Kurt Debus who was responsible for the high voltage equipment related to the Bell. And he worked later for NASA. He was one of the directors of NASA. 没有迹象表明沃纳・冯・布劳恩或者所有的火箭科学家都参与了这个项目，除了一个。有一个人的名字是库尔特德布斯谁负责有关的贝尔高压设备。后来他为美国宇航局工作。他是美国国家航空航天局的主管之一

BR: Joseph Farrell showed us some interesting photographs of Kurt Debus and Wernher von Braun together at NASA, which is an interesting question. It remains unanswered. 比尔: Joseph Farrell 给我们看了一些 Kurt Debus 和沃纳・冯・布劳恩一起在 NASA 工作的有趣的照片，这是一个有趣的问题。这个问题仍然没有得到解答

IW: Yes. IW: 是的

BR: What... 比尔：什么... ..

KC: He’s working on rocket, not just NASA but working in Florida on a rocket program. 他在研究火箭，不仅仅是 NASA，还在佛罗里达研究火箭项目

IW: Debus was one of the few, the only one scientist that was recruited from IW: Debus 是为数不多的，唯一一个被招募的科学家 Peenemünde. And that is probably why he has been employed by the NASA after the war, becoming one of its directors. There is no indication at all, I mean, at least I didn’t found any, saying that this project or this entire field of physics was continued in the United States after the war. 佩内明德。这可能就是为什么他在战后受雇于美国宇航局，成为其主管之一。没有任何迹象表明，我的意思是，至少我没有发现任何迹象，说这个项目或整个物理学领域在战后在美国继续进行

I couldn’t find anything except for the very modern research by Sandia Laboratories which were experimenting with such vortices and so on. But shortly after the war, no, I couldn’t find any confirmation that it was continued in the United States or evacuated to United States. 除了桑迪亚实验室正在对这种漩涡等进行实验的非常现代的研究之外，我什么也找不到。但是战争结束后不久，没有，我找不到任何证据证明它在美国继续存在或者被疏散到美国

BR: But the implication of what you are saying is that if the personnel and resources and the Bell itself were evacuated maybe to Argentina, then presumably that would have been with the intention of the project being continued there. What happened to that? 比尔：但是你所说的意思是，如果人员和资源以及贝尔本身被疏散到阿根廷，那么大概就意味着该项目将在那里继续进行。这是怎么回事？

IW: The continuation of the project in Argentina took place until the fall of the Perón government. After that the entire research team has been disbanded. The main scientist, which was Ronald Richter, started fearing about his life, and, as far as I know, he has escaped from Argentina. So it was continued but to some extent. I’m not sure if it was finished. When I was talking with one of the directors of the research center built for the Germans there, he suggested to me clearly that it is still a subject of secrecy and that he has no access to such documents. IW: 阿根廷的项目一直持续到贝隆政府垮台。在那之后，整个研究小组被解散了。主要的科学家，罗纳德里希特，开始担心他的生活，据我所知，他已经逃离阿根廷。因此，它继续，但在某种程度上。我不确定它是否完成了。当我和那里为德国人建造的研究中心的一位主任谈话时，他清楚地向我暗示，这仍然是一个保密的问题，他不能接触到这样的文件

BR: But that’s fascinating. I mean, this is something which we haven’t heard about in this detail. That’s fascinating. So you are saying that it is known that there is a research facility in Argentina that was devoted to this Nazi science and you’ve got access into some of those details. 比尔：但是那很有趣。我的意思是，这是我们从来没有听说过的细节。真有意思。你是说众所周知，在阿根廷有一个研究机构，专门研究纳粹科学，你可以了解其中的一些细节

IW: Yes, there is a set of documents pertaining to work carried out in the Research Institute of the AG Consortium during the war by Debus and by Richter who was continuing the project in Argentina. There is a clear reference in these documents, a connection between plasma physics and gravity, and the same connection appears later on in the Argentine context, but it was discontinued for unclear reasons. IW: 是的，有一套关于战争期间德布斯和继续在阿根廷进行该项目的里希特在 AG 集团研究所开展的工作的文件。这些文件中明确提到了等离子体物理学和重力之间的联系，后来在阿根廷出现了同样的联系，但由于不明原因而中断

BR: Now... 比尔：现在... ..

KC: Okay, but what are you saying in terms of the evacuation committee, the relationship between the evacuation committee and these scientists who were working here? 好的，但是关于疏散委员会，疏散委员会和这些在这里工作的科学家之间的关系，你是怎么说的？

IW: Mm-hmm. IW: 嗯

KC: Wasn’t there some relationship between the SS who were in charge of the evacuation and the scientists who were working on the project here? 负责疏散的党卫军和这个项目的科学家之间不是有什么关系吗？

IW: There was no such direct relation because a different body was responsible for the evacuation. Different institution was responsible for the evacuation and different one coordinated the research itself here. So there is no connection between the evacuation, the personnel from the evacuation and the scientists, no direct connection. IW: 没有这样的直接关系，因为疏散是另一个机构负责的。不同的机构负责疏散，不同的机构协调这里的研究工作。所以撤离人员、撤离人员和科学家之间没有联系，没有直接联系

KC: But weren’t the scientists evacuated? 科学家们不是已经撤离了吗？

IW: Some of the scientists were evacuated but not all of them. Two went up in Argentina, ended up in Argentina, which is Richter; there was some engineer from the AG, associated with the AG Research Institute named Hermann, who continued the work there in Argentina, but I don’t remember all the details of it. IW: 一些科学家被疏散，但不是全部。有两个在阿根廷升起，最后到了阿根廷，这是里希特；有一些来自 AG 的工程师，与 AG 研究所有关，名叫赫尔曼，他继续在阿根廷的工作，但我不记得所有的细节

KC: Okay, and where are the other scientists, where did the other scientists go, if not to Argentina? 好的，其他的科学家在哪里，其他的科学家去哪里了，如果不是去阿根廷的话？

IW: Frankly saying, I know only about three, four or five persons associated with this project. Of course the number has to be higher, but I know just about a few of them and the most significant, Professor Walter Gerlach, stayed in Germany after the war but he never, not only returned to what he was doing during the war, but he never published any scientific publications about the same subjects in which he was involved in before the war, for example. He just completely detached himself from this field of physics. IW: 坦率地说，我只知道大约三个，四个或五个人与这个项目有关。当然这个数字必须更高，但是我只知道其中的几个，最重要的是，沃尔特・格拉赫教授，战后留在了德国，但是他从来没有，不仅没有回到战争期间的工作，而且他从来没有发表过任何科学出版物，例如，关于他在战前参与的同样的主题。他完全脱离了物理学这个领域

KC: What about the other four? 其他四个呢？

IW: Debus was employed by NASA in the United States, although he was an SS officer. And an ardent one. And he never, wasn’t interested as well to go back to such a subjects, because one can imagine that it involved possible accusations about experiments on humans or wanting to, you know, wipe out some significant part of the population of the United States, for example, which implied him. So he wasn’t interested in going back to such subjects either. 德布斯在美国受雇于美国国家航空航天局，尽管他是一名党卫军军官。也是一个热情的人。他从来没有，也从来没有兴趣回到这样一个主题，因为人们可以想象，它可能涉及对人体实验的指控，或者想要，你知道，消灭一些重要的部分美国人口，例如，这暗示着他。所以他也没有兴趣回到这些话题上来

One of the scientists, professor and SS Gruppenführer Ernst Grawitz, committed suicide before the end of the war, so there is a... this story has disconnected. And the other ones... I don’t know details about their fates. 其中一位科学家，教授兼党卫军领袖恩斯特・格拉维茨，在战争结束前自杀身亡，所以有一个。. 这个故事已经断开了。至于其他人... 我不知道他们命运的细节

BR: Okay. What happened to Hans Kammler? And, maybe just tell us a little bit about who Hans Kammler was... 比尔：好的。汉斯・卡姆勒发生了什么事？还有，也许你可以告诉我们一点汉斯・卡姆勒是谁... ..

IW: Okay. IW: 好的

BR: ...and why he was such an important figure.

IW: Because of various reasons, Hitler has decided to entrust the management of the most secret and most state-of-the-art armament projects in the hands of one man who was SS General, Hans Kammler, who was very skilled organizer and very ruthless as well. But he was, in a way, [a] materialization of a certain trend of SS grasping even more fields of the German economy and, among other things, Kammler has controlled all the production of jet fighters, of jet airplanes, of the rocket missiles and various other fields, and he became [a] very influential person in the Third Reich. 由于种种原因，希特勒决定把最机密、最先进的军备项目交给一个人管理，这个人就是党卫军将军汉斯・卡姆勒，他是一个非常熟练的组织者，也是一个非常残忍的人。但在某种程度上，他实现了党卫军在德国经济中占据更多领域的某种趋势，除其他外，卡姆勒控制了喷气式战斗机、喷气式飞机、火箭导弹和其他各种领域的所有生产，他成为了第三帝国非常有影响力的人物

But it is completely unclear what happened to him. He has disappeared in the occupied Czech territories and there is no... never any traces surfaced which would indicate that he ended up in some other country or something. I don’t know but he... 但是他到底发生了什么事情还完全不清楚。他在被占领的捷克领土上失踪了，没有... ... 没有任何迹象表明他最后去了其他国家或其他什么地方。我不知道但是他..

KC: So he was instrumental, though, you are saying that he was basically running, for all intensive purposes, this Riese... 所以他是乐器，虽然，你是说他基本上是在跑步，为了所有的集中目的，这个里斯..

IW: Facility, complex. Yeah. 设施，复杂。是的

KC: ...facility or complex or whatever you want to call it. 设施或者复合体或者随便你怎么称呼它

IW: Both. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yes, he was instrumental in controlling not only the Riese and the larger S3 undertaking, but virtually all the most state-of-the-art and crucial armament projects of the Third Reich by the end of the war. And then he has vanished. He just disappeared somewhere in the occupied Czech territories and there was never any trace of him after the war. 两者都有。嗯哼。嗯哼。是的，在战争结束时，他不仅控制了里斯和更大的 S3 任务，而且实际上控制了第三帝国所有最先进的和关键的军备项目。然后他就消失了。他只是消失在被占领的捷克领土的某个地方，战后再也没有他的任何踪迹

KC: Was there ever any indication that Hitler visited the Riese? 有没有任何迹象表明希特勒访问了里泽？

IW: There are rumors that he did but... and nearby there was underground headquarters, Hitler’s headquarters, under construction. But personally, I believe that he didn’t visit it, because it would attract attention of the enemies to this place which was still almost unknown except for the Russians which were very well oriented in this business. 伊万・沃克：有传言说他做了，但是... ... 附近有一个地下司令部，希特勒的司令部，正在建设中。但就我个人而言，我相信他没有去过那里，因为那里会吸引敌人的注意力，而这个地方除了俄罗斯人以外，几乎没有人知道，俄罗斯人对这个行业非常熟悉

KC: What do you mean the Russians were well oriented in this business? 你是什么意思，俄罗斯人在这个行业很有方向感？

IW: Several years ago, I have talked with a man who was employee of the Academy of the General Staff in Poland, military, and he told me about who coordinated, for example, the scientific aspect of the intelligence reconnaissance of this area on the Russian side. And he has mentioned certain person who... Lev Andreevich Artsimovich, academician – which is something higher than professor in the former Soviet Union. IW: 几年前，我和一个波兰总参谋部的雇员谈过，他告诉我是谁在协调，例如，俄罗斯方面在这个地区的情报侦察的科学方面。他还提到了某个人，列夫・安德烈维奇・阿尔茨莫维奇院士，他的级别比前苏联的教授还要高

And, as later I have checked out, he was specializing in thermonuclear physics and plasma physics and exactly was more or less the equivalent of Gerlach. So they had to have a pretty good and clear idea about what was going on here, contrary to the Western allies. 而且，正如后来我查明的那样，他专攻热核物理和等离子物理，而且确切地说或多或少相当于格拉赫。因此，与西方盟国相反，他们必须对这里发生的事情有一个非常好和清晰的认识

KC: This sounds like there must have been some kind of on-the-ground relationship between the Russians and the Germans during that time. 听起来那段时间俄国人和德国人之间一定有某种地面上的关系

IW: Yes. It is a very interesting question and such a relationship can be traced back to the pre-war period. In a very strange and amazing way. Namely that Professor Walter Gerlach was trying to make something on the basis of such a vortices that I mentioned on the solitons, has consulted the Soviet Nobel Prize winner, Pyotr Kapitsa – who was of Polish origins by the way, his parents were Polish – and because Kapitsa has developed theory describing such a vortices before the war. It pertained to so-called super fluidity but the description is the same because this are almost the same kinds of vortices. So there was such a cooperation... IW: 是的。这是一个非常有趣的问题，这种关系可以追溯到战前时期。以一种非常奇怪和令人惊奇的方式。也就是说，沃尔特・格拉赫教授试图在孤子的基础上制造某种东西，他咨询了苏联诺贝尔奖获得者皮奥特・卡皮察 (Pyotr Kapitsa)—— 顺便说一句，他的父母是波兰人 —— 因为卡皮察在战前就发展了描述这种漩涡的理论。它涉及到所谓的超流动性，但描述是相同的，因为这几乎是相同类型的涡旋。所以有这样的合作..

KC: Hmm. KC: 嗯

IW: ...probably Kapitsa, or the Soviet partner of Gerlach, wasn’t aware of what was the purpose of that. And, obviously it was before the beginning of the war with the Soviet Union. But there are certain connections between the Third Reich and the Soviet Union in this respect, often amazing ones. IW: ... ... 可能是 Kapitsa，或者 Gerlach 的苏联合作伙伴，不知道这样做的目的。而且，很明显，那是在与苏联开战之前。但是在这方面，第三帝国和苏联之间存在着某种联系，这种联系往往是令人惊异的

BR: Let me ask you a question which goes into a different area here. I’m still really interested in the Argentina connection... 比尔：让我问你一个问题，这个问题涉及到另一个领域。我仍然对阿根廷的联系很感兴趣..

IW: Mm-hm. IW: 嗯哼

BR: ...and how you say that, as far as you can tell, that activity ceased around about the breakup of the Perón administration. But surely after the war, the Americans would have been very aware of what was happening in Argentina. Their intelligence capacity would have informed them of what they were doing. Surely the Americans knew about all of this.

IW: I’m not sure if the Americans knew this because – just an example to give you some idea – there was a very ambitious effort by the Israeli Special Services [Mossad] to kill the Nazi war criminals hiding in Argentina after the war. And it all failed, and as far as I know from the materials that I saw – commonly known only that it may not be known in the UK or the United States, but it is based on the materials published in Poland – it seems that they didn’t even manage to work out how the Nazi organizations work in Argentina. IW: 我不确定美国人是否知道这一点，因为以色列特种部队 (摩萨德) 曾经雄心勃勃地试图消灭战后藏匿在阿根廷的纳粹战犯。但是这一切都失败了，就我所看到的材料来看 —— 通常只知道在英国或美国可能不知道，但是它是基于在波兰出版的材料 —— 似乎他们甚至没有设法弄清楚纳粹组织在阿根廷是如何运作的

They didn’t really have an idea. That is my impression. So I’m not really sure. It was a very well organized system created by the Germans in Argentina. It was not a group of amateurs. They were all professionals and it was pre-arranged and very well planned. And it worked like a professional system and had backing of the Argentine services, such as counter intelligence. They co-worked with each other. And I wouldn’t say that it is so obvious that the United States knew about what was going on at the time. I’m not that sure. 他们并没有真正的想法。这是我的印象。所以我不是很确定。这是一个由德国人在阿根廷创建的非常有组织的系统。这不是一群业余爱好者。他们都是专业人士，这是事先安排好的，计划得非常周密。它像一个专业系统一样运作，并得到阿根廷情报部门的支持，比如反情报部门。他们彼此合作。我不会说美国知道当时发生了什么是如此明显。我不是很确定

BR: There must have been something in it for Argentina as a state though. There must have been some 比尔：作为一个国家，阿根廷一定有些什么，一定有些什么quid pro quo 交换条件, some exchange for Argentina, for them to have taken this risk of harboring all of this activity, these resources, these scientists, this technology. 一些交换给阿根廷，让他们冒险包庇所有这些活动，这些资源，这些科学家，这项技术

IW: Yes, there was a kind of a deal... IW: 是的，有一种交易... ..

BR: Mm-hm. 比尔：嗯

IW: ...between the Germans and certain people or services from Argentina, because... not with Argentina as such; a deal in which the Argentines got the technology which they tried to develop later on. They got a lot of money from the capitals of the Nazi party, of the SS, of the Third Reich as a whole, in exchange providing security and some kind of hideout for these people. It was kind of a deal and mutually beneficial. 伊恩・沃克: ... ... 德国人和某些来自阿根廷的人或者服务之间，因为... ... 不是和阿根廷本身；阿根廷人得到了他们后来试图发展的技术。他们从纳粹党的首都，党卫军的首都，整个第三帝国的首都得到了大量的钱，作为交换，他们为这些人提供了安全保障和某种藏身之处。这是一种互惠互利的交易

KC: But didn’t you say that there were companies that developed relationships – I think maybe you even said... 但是你不是说过有些公司发展了关系吗？我想你可能说过..

IW: Yeah. IW: 是的

KC: ...even before the war with the Germans... with Argentine companies, because there were materials in Argentina that they were bringing and shipping over here for use.

IW: Yes. IW: 是的

KC: Even perhaps in the Riese area. 甚至可能在 Riese 地区

IW: Yes. Always the Germany maintained a very high-level industrial links with Argentina, or commercial links, even before the war. And because there is – that is one of the reasons – because there is a very high German minority there. It may not be very numerous but it is influential and always was influential. And these personal connections or connections between institutions, for example, Peròn was educated in a German military academy, later on he served as an Argentine military attaché in Berlin. IW: 是的。即使在战前，德国与阿根廷一直保持着非常高水平的工业联系或商业联系。因为那里有很多德国少数民族，这也是原因之一。它可能不是非常多，但它是有影响力的，总是有影响力的。这些机构之间的个人联系，例如，佩尔因在德国军事学院接受教育，后来他在柏林担任阿根廷武官

And so they didn’t really have to look far for such a connection. It was natural and that natural extension of such links was that, during the war, Argentina as a neutral country has provided precious for the war raw materials for the Third Reich. And later on the same connections, the same links, the same organizational infrastructure was used to evacuate certain things to Argentina, so there was a fluent transition from one stage to another. It was... 所以他们并不需要去寻找这样的联系。这种联系的自然延伸是很自然的，在战争期间，阿根廷作为一个中立国为第三帝国的战争提供了宝贵的原材料。后来，同样的连接，同样的连接，同样的组织基础设施被用来疏散到阿根廷的某些东西，所以从一个阶段到另一个阶段有一个流畅的过渡。那是..

KC: But weren’t there also certain raw materials that are special? In other words, they can’t be found in Europe, that you said that Germany was getting from Argentina. 但是不是也有一些特别的原材料吗？换句话说，它们在欧洲是找不到的，你说德国是从阿根廷进口的

IW: Yes, Argentina was a kind of a gateway to the entire South America from which they could obtain various precious materials such as platinum, such as tungsten ... a whole lot of stuff, and it worked very well. Argentina could ship it to Spain, for example, or to Sweden. Even grains, such as rye, food in large numbers and it worked very well. 是的，阿根廷是一个通往整个南美洲的门户，从那里他们可以获得各种各样的贵重材料，比如钨... ... 各种各样的东西，而且效果非常好。例如，阿根廷可以将其运往西班牙或瑞典。即使是像黑麦这样的谷物，大量的食物也能很好的发挥作用

KC: What about the close proximity to Antarctica ... of Argentina? 那么接近南极洲的阿根廷呢？

IW: [sigh] For a long time, I thought that it’s a kind of a fantasy that Antarctica, the Antarctic played a role in such measures, but once I have received a signal saying the contrary. It was very strange, because I just thought that... I just couldn’t imagine the Antarctic being used for such a... to build a base, for example. Because there is, it is not a place to live. There is no infrastructure, nothing at all. Moreover, everything is visible from the air. IW: (叹气) 很长时间以来，我一直认为南极洲、南极洲在这些措施中扮演了一定的角色是一种幻想，但是有一次我收到了一个相反的信号。这是非常奇怪的，因为我只是想... 我只是无法想象南极被用来做这样一个。. 比如说，建立一个基地。因为有，所以它不是一个适合居住的地方。没有基础设施，什么都没有。此外，一切都可以从空中看到

But apparently there was some ... a net of supplying bases, provisional bases out there, maybe not exactly in the Antarctic but on the islands surrounding the Antarctic, lying between the Antarctic and South America, for example. Because once I have had such a signal, yes, that there was some Germans who were performing some duty there. 但是显然有一些... ... 供应基地和临时基地的网络，也许不完全是在南极，而是在南极周围的岛屿上，例如南极洲和南美洲之间。因为一旦我收到这样的信号，是的，有一些德国人在那里执行某种任务

BR: What do you mean a signal? Do you mean a clue? Do you mean some information? Do you mean something that somebody told you? What does that mean, a signal? 比尔：你说信号是什么意思？你是说线索吗？你是说一些信息吗？你是指别人告诉你的事情吗？那是什么意思，信号？

IW: One of the clues that our services had after the war about evacuation of this things, about the activity of the special evacuations commander to be exact, was coming from a German courier, which was contacting the agents left here. I mean not exactly in this area but somewhere else, but also related to this research and to the activity of the evacuation commander. And he was arrested, and testified, but he didn’t know very much. 伊万・沃克：我们在战后得到的关于撤离这些东西的线索之一，准确地说，是关于特别撤离指挥官的活动，来自一名德国信使，他当时正在联系留在这里的特工。我指的不是这个地区，而是其他地方，但也与这项研究和疏散指挥官的活动有关。他被逮捕，并作证，但他知道的不多

Basically, the only thing that he knew is that these things had been evacuated somewhere, to some place lying far in the South. He came from Uruguay so one could guess that it’s about South America or farther in the South. But he has only mentioned one geographical name of a company. It wasn’t certain what it was, name anyway: Aborus [Ed. Note: spelling uncertain]. 基本上，他只知道这些东西已经被疏散到某个地方，远在南方的某个地方。他来自乌拉圭，所以人们可以猜测这是关于南美洲或者更远的南方。但他只提到了一家公司的一个地理名称。它不确定它是什么，反正名字是: Aborus [爱德华]。注意：拼写不确定]

And for years and for decades various people, as far as I know, were trying before me, trying to unravel what it was, what it could have been. And nobody has ever found any clue about it. But once, unexpectedly, I have received such a signal, such an information, namely that one of the crucial persons involved in the evacuations, generally – evacuations of the SS. I don’t know if he knew anything about the Bell and so on – but one of the crucial persons on the part of the SS as far as the evacuations were concerned to South America was a certain officer named Gottfried Sandstäter [Ed. Note: we were unable to track the correct spelling of this name] working there as an agent. 几年来，几十年来，据我所知，各种各样的人，都在我之前尝试，试图弄清楚它是什么，它可能是什么。没有人找到任何线索。但有一次，出乎意料的是，我收到了这样的信号，这样的信息，即参与疏散的关键人员之一，普遍疏散党卫军。我不知道他是否知道关于贝尔的任何事情，但是纳粹党卫军在撤退到南美洲时最关键的人物之一是一个名叫 Gottfried Sandstäter [Ed] 的军官。注意：我们无法以代理的身份跟踪这个名字的正确拼写]

And my friend, a friend of mine calling, has managed to talk to his son. And his son has said two things. That the Aborus existed. I mean, he didn’t really want to talk about it but... it was uneasy subject for him. But such a thing as Aborus did exist and it was a base for the submarines in Argentina. And the other thing, he has just shortly mentioned that his father has shortly, for a short time, for half a year after the war, has served duty on the Antarctic. And it was the only confirmation saying that the Antarctic played some role in such an evacuation. Although I disregarded this initially because it didn’t seem possible for me to establish anything of that. 我的朋友，我的一个朋友打电话来，设法和他的儿子说话。他的儿子说了两件事。那个堕胎者的存在。我的意思是，他并不是真的想谈论这个话题，但是... ... 这对他来说是一个令人不安的话题。但是，这样的事情作为 Aborus 确实存在，它是一个基地的潜艇在阿根廷。还有一件事，他刚才简短地提到，他的父亲在战争结束后的短暂时间里，在南极服役了半年。这也是唯一证实南极洲在这种疏散中扮演了某种角色的证据。尽管一开始我忽略了这一点，因为我似乎不可能建立任何关于这一点的东西

BR: I remember that Joseph Farrell showed us some photographs of this huge Junkers six-engine plane that was known to have evacuated a lot of material to Norway, I believe it was. Is that right? Have I understood that right? 比尔：我记得约瑟夫・法雷尔给我们看了一些照片，这是一架巨大的容克斯六引擎飞机，据我所知，它曾将大量物质疏散到挪威。是这样吗？我理解得对吗？

IW: Yes. IW: 是的

BR: And if so, what happened after that? 比尔：如果是这样，那之后发生了什么？

IW: Yes. There was a special plane, in fact appropriated by Hans Kammler who was coordinating, who played some part in the evacuations as well. And this plane supposedly took the – I’m not sure – something related to the Bell Project or to the Chronos Project. I’m not sure if it was the Bell itself or just the documentations, but something related to the project, and landed in Norway, in the border base in the north of Norway which was one of the few relatively safe airbases that the Germans had at the end of the war. IW: 是的。有一架特殊的飞机，事实上是由汉斯・卡姆勒 (Hans Kammler) 使用的，他负责协调，在疏散行动中也发挥了一定作用。这架飞机可能带走了，我不确定，一些与贝尔计划或者克罗诺斯计划有关的东西。我不确定这是贝尔本身还是文件，但是与这个项目有关的东西，降落在挪威，在挪威北部的边境基地，这是德国在战争结束时拥有的为数不多的相对安全的空军基地之一

And then for some time, the trace has vanished. I mean no plane, nothing. And only after many years, my coworker from South America, from Uruguay, has reported to me that there is a photograph of this plane that was supposedly made near the town – on the airstrip in the jungle – near the town of Gualeguay in Uruguay. And supposedly the shipment has been moved to Argentina, evacuated to Bariloche in Argentina, and they just got rid of the plane in the... leaving it in the... pulling it into the Uruguay River and supposedly it is still lying on the river bed. I didn’t check it out. 然后过了一段时间，痕迹消失了。我是说没有飞机，什么都没有。多年以后，我来自南美的同事，来自乌拉圭，向我报告说，有一张这架飞机的照片，据说是在瓜莱瓜伊附近的一个丛林简易机场附近拍摄的。据推测，这批货物已经被运往阿根廷，被疏散到 Bariloche，他们刚刚把飞机处理掉在... ... 把它留在... ... 把它拖进乌拉圭河，据推测它现在还躺在河床上。我没去查

BR: That’s a fascinating story. That plane could have, it had the range to go from Norway to Argentina or to Uruguay if necessary. 比尔：真是个迷人的故事。那架飞机可以，它的航程可以从挪威飞到阿根廷，如果必要的话还可以飞到乌拉圭

IW: It didn’t have the range to go to Argentina directly because it’s around 15,000 kilometers or so from Norway, but it could go to Uruguay. And in fact it was one of the very few airplanes able to refuel in flight. IW: 它没有直达阿根廷的航程，因为它距离挪威大约 15000 公里，但它可以直达乌拉圭。事实上，它是极少数能够在空中加油的飞机之一

BR: That’s interesting. I didn’t know they had that technology in the war. 比尔：有意思。我不知道他们在战争中有这种技术

IW: And they did. IW: 他们做到了

KC: Okay. But also, didn’t you say that there were thousands evacuated? Wasn’t... 好的。但是，你不是说有成千上万的人被疏散了吗？不是..

IW: I mean... not... 我的意思是... 不是..

KC: ...there a number? Did you say 50,000? 有一个数字吗？你是说五万吗？

IW: There are around 50,000 Germans emigrated, or more officially or unofficially, or under false names, to Argentina. That’s what is estimated. And the question is, how many of them were really evacuated in a pre-planned way. It is estimated that the order of 5,000 or ten percent. It’s hard to say, really. 大约有 50,000 德国人移民到阿根廷，或者更多的官方或非官方移民，或者使用假名。这是估计的。问题是，他们中有多少人是按照事先计划的方式撤离的。据估计，大约有 5,000 到 10% 。这很难说，真的

BR: That’s a fascinating mystery again. We’ve got mysteries within mysteries here. There’s so much... 比尔：这又是一个迷人的谜团。我们在谜团中找到了谜团。有这么多... ..

IW: Yeah. IW: 是的

BR: ...that’s still unknown, even 60 years later. We still don’t...

IW: I remember in [unclear] but for the record, as you wish, but just a curiosity... I remember a documentary in which some Jew was telling his story about his emigration to South America where he had some family, shortly after the war. He wanted to go to Argentina, but they didn’t let him in, obviously. So he took a ship to Uruguay which is on the other side of the La Plata River. And he recalled one day in the afternoon on the ship, somebody has raised a glass of wine or something, and saying to somebody else by the other table, that, ‘Herr Captain, you have killed 5,000 Jews,’ and raised the glass. IW: 我记得在 [不清楚] ，但为了记录，如你所愿，但只是好奇... ... 我记得在一部纪录片中，一个犹太人讲述了他在战后不久移民到南美的故事，他在那里有一些家人。他想去阿根廷，但他们显然不让他进去。所以他乘船去了 La Plata River 另一边的乌拉圭。他回忆起有一天下午在船上，有人举起一杯酒或者别的什么，对坐在另一张桌子旁的另一个人说，‘船长先生，你杀了 5000 个犹太人’，然后举起了酒杯

BR: That’s amazing. 比尔：太神奇了

IW: No it was really... what they were doing out there in Argentina. They knew that they are safe and they did it pretty much openly. I mean... IW: 不，这真的是... ... 他们在阿根廷做的事。他们知道自己是安全的，而且他们几乎是公开地这样做。我是说..

BR: Mmh. 比尔：嗯

IW: ...for example, one of the key persons in the Nazi structure, in the organization, in Bariloche, had a false name, for example, but when he establish a company, the company had the assessorants in the name, in the log. So it was pretty much open.

BR: Yeah there’s so many... There’s so... 比尔：是啊，有很多... ... 有很多... ..

KC: Oh, very interesting. What is, I just have to ask, this mountain, you say that the entrance or... 哦，非常有趣。什么是，我只是想问，这座山，你说的入口还是..

IW: I mean ... here, yes? IW: 我的意思是... ... 在这里，是吗？

KC: Yes, here. You’re saying that we’re quite close to. You’re saying the entrance seems to have been bombed or closed. KC: 是的，这里。你是说我们已经很接近。你是说入口好像被炸了或者关闭了

IW: Blown up. 放大

KC: Blown up. 爆炸了

IW: Because you know, if you want to blow up entrance to a tunnel, you drill holes at that of, actually in this case, the order of two meters, and the explosive charge is placed on the end of that hole. So, when it explodes, you then have pieces of rock with holes going through from one side to another, you know. So, from that you can guess that it has been... it didn’t collapse naturally. IW: 因为你知道，如果你想炸毁隧道的入口，你要在那里钻洞，实际上，是两米左右，炸药装在那个洞的末端。所以，当它爆炸的时候，你就会看到一块块带洞的石头从一边穿到另一边。因此，你可以猜测它已经... 它不是自然坍塌的

BR: Yeah. I understand that, I’ve seen things like that in mines. 比尔：是的，我明白，我在矿井里见过这样的事情

IW: I will show you that because it’s a... IW: 我会给你看的，因为它是... ..

BR: Yeah. 比尔：是的

IW: ...15 minutes walk. 步行 15 分钟

KC: But where... 但是在哪里..

IW: Not in this conditions. IW: 在这种情况下不行

KC: I see. But do you have any evidence or have you gotten any evidence... 我明白了。但是你有任何证据或者你有任何证据..

IW: Mm-hm. IW: 嗯哼

KC: ...that when it was closed down, when did they close it off?

IW: No, nothing. Only that piece of information from the former presenters, from Gross-Rosen. Very few people have survived accidentally. I mean, there was evacuation in March of 1945. The trains going from one station to another and then back because the front has shifted from unexpectedly, and such a things, and sometimes it happens that a prisoner managed to escape from such a train. You know, it was complete chaos at that time. But, as I mentioned, all those who worked in the finished part of the Riese have been... just never left this place. IW: 不，没有。只有从前主持人那里得到的信息，来自 Gross-Rosen。很少有人能意外幸存下来。我的意思是，1945 年 3 月有人撤离。火车从一个车站开到另一个车站，然后又开回来，因为前面出乎意料地偏离了，诸如此类的事情，有时候，一个囚犯设法从这样的火车上逃了出来。你知道，当时一片混乱。但是，正如我所提到的，所有那些在里泽河完工的地方工作的人... ... 从来没有离开过这个地方

KC: Mm-hm. KC: 嗯

BR: Yeah. Their secrets died with them. 比尔：是的，他们的秘密也随之消失了

IW: That was the simplest method. IW: 那是最简单的方法

BR: The simplest method. These guys, it’s very, very hard for us to understand. 比尔：最简单的方法。这些家伙，对我们来说很难理解

IW: A practical approach. IW: 一个实用的方法

BR: Yeah, pragmatic. 比尔：是的，很实际

KC: So what you’re saying is... you’re talking about 20,000 prisoners. 所以你的意思是... 你说的是两万名囚犯

IW: Just over 20,000, yeah. 刚刚超过 20000，是的

KC: Now, in terms of... KC: 现在，就... ..

IW: Supposedly they were driven underground, it took three days. Because you know, 20,000 it’s a population of a small town. You just don’t... it’s not like entering the bath, you know, just go in. So it’s a lot of people. So whole trains. 伊恩・沃克：据说他们是被迫转入地下的，花了三天时间。因为你知道，两万人口只相当于一个小镇的人口。你只是不... 这不像进浴缸，你知道，只是进去。所以有很多人。所以整列火车

KC: You’re saying it took three days. Are you saying... 你是说花了三天时间。你是说... ..

IW: Supposedly. I knew a guy from our services who got locked at [name unclear and our search wasn’t conclusive; sounds like “Matt Unions”]. He’s dead. I’ve collected sessions [same name, unclear] and among other things, supposedly, he had such a testimony or document. I don’t know what it was. 应该是吧。我认识一个我们部门的人，他被锁定了 [姓名不详，我们的搜索结果也不确定，听起来像 “ Matt Unions”]。他死了。我曾经收集过一些谈话 (同名，不清楚) ，据说，除了其他事情之外，他还有这样一份证词或文件。我不知道那是什么

KC: But wouldn’t this, I mean, in a sense... I don’t know what the actual numbers were for the death of the people in the various camps in Nazi Germany, but the overall numbers. 但是这不是吗，我的意思是，在某种意义上... ... 我不知道纳粹德国各个集中营中死亡人数的实际数字是多少，但是总的数字

IW: Okay. IW: 好的

KC: How does this 20,000 compare, for example, to the number who died at Auschwitz and so on? 比如说，这两万人和在奥斯维辛集中营死去的人数相比怎么样？

IW: It’s very little. All this prisoners, the number of all this prisoners going through the Gross-Rosen concentration camp was relatively known to us. I don’t know really, I don’t know, but it’s the order of 100,000 compared to around three and a half millions, exterminated in Auschwitz I guess. I’m not sure. So it wasn’t much, but you know, all the combined number of prisoners going through the subcamps of the Riese was around 40,000 or 50,000. So 20,000 in this respect was quite a lot. So, generally, very few people have survived who have anything to say about it. IW: 非常少。所有这些囚犯，所有这些经过格罗斯 - 罗森集中营的囚犯的数量对我们来说是相对知道的。我真的不知道，我不知道，但是大概有 100,000 人，而在奥斯维辛，大概有 350 万人被屠杀。我不确定。所以这个数字并不多，但是你知道，所有进入里斯人分支集中营的囚犯加起来大约有 4 万到 5 万人。所以两万在这方面是相当多的。所以，一般来说，很少有人能幸存下来，对此有话可说

KC: Hmm. KC: 嗯

IW: Very few. 很少

BR: Yes. It’s not a question of these guys going into an extermination camp. They were just presumably exterminated once they ceased to become useful. It’s... this is the expedient approach... 比尔：是的。这不是这些家伙进入灭绝营的问题。一旦它们不再有用，可能就会被消灭。这... 这是权宜之计..

IW: Mm-hm. Exactly. IW: 嗯，没错

BR: ...which these guys had. 比尔: ... 这些家伙有

IW: Only the project, generally the project, may I say? It’s... IW: 只有这个项目，通常是这个项目，我可以这么说吗

KC: Yes. KC: 是的

BR: Yes? Best of all. 比尔：是吗？最好的

IW: Apparently the entire project was a result of a cooperation between the SS and the Luftwaffe who had a monopoly on the Air Force, generally. Luftwaffe is ‘air force’ in German. And the Luftwaffe wanted to create much better conditions for the prisoners, and according to the prisoner who worked in technical chancellory of the Gross-Rosen camp, there was a special commander of prisoners in Ludwikowice and Ludwigsdorf, where the Henge is, which was under supervision of the Luftwaffe, not of the SS, which had pretty exceptional conditions, exceptionally good. 显然，整个计划是党卫军和德国空军合作的结果，后者通常垄断了空军。德国空军在德语中是空军。德国空军希望为战俘创造更好的条件，根据在格罗斯罗森集中营技术总理办公室工作的战俘所说，在 Ludwikowice 和路德维希斯多夫有一个特殊的战俘指挥官，那里的 “亨格” 号是在德国空军的监督下，而不是党卫军的监督下，党卫军的条件非常特殊，非常好

Normal meals with milk, warm dinners, unlike in the concentration camp of the SS. But supposedly it was some special commander working on something very important. And obviously, as one can guess, they didn’t survive. Sometimes such exceptions had happened that the conditions were much better. There was also a special commander of children here used for the experiments, around 200 children, supposedly. 正常膳食与牛奶，温暖的晚餐，不同于党卫军的集中营。但据说是某个特别指挥官在做一件非常重要的事情。很明显，我们可以猜到，他们没能活下来。有时这样的例外情况发生时，条件要好得多。这里还有一位特殊的儿童指挥官，据推测大约有 200 名儿童被用来做实验

BR: Hmm. 比尔：嗯

IW: I have to check it out, but there is a researcher specializing in such things. IW: 我得去看看，不过有个研究员专门研究这方面的东西

KC: Well, that would be of special interest because the use of children or... 凯瑟琳：嗯，那将是特别有意义的，因为使用儿童或... ..

IW: Mentally handicapped children. 智障儿童

BR: Mmh. 比尔：嗯

KC: Oh mentally hand... really? Do you know, were they autistic? 哦，精神上的手... 真的吗？你知道，他们是自闭症患者吗？

IW: I don’t know that. IW: 我不知道

BR: Mmh. Okay. 比尔：嗯，好的

KC: Because there is some new information coming forward about autism and the link between autism... 因为有一些关于孤独症和孤独症之间联系的新信息正在出现

IW: Uh-huh. IW: 嗯

KC: ...and being precognitive. In other words, seeing the future.

IW: I mean, there is a... 我的意思是，有一个..

KC: And there would be some link to Chronos. 肯定会有和克罗诺斯的联系

IW: There is an assumption that they were used for the experiments, because one of the persons playing a crucial role here, which I just forgot to say about him, was Professor Hubertus Strughold who was pioneer of space-medicine and he ran an underground facility nearby which is, as I mentioned, there was an SS, special S3 undertaking encompassing Riese, probably the Ludwikowice-Ludwigsdorf and various other places, facilities, and one of them was the underground space-research facility run by Professor Hubertus Strughold. IW: 有一个假设，它们被用于实验，因为在这里扮演关键角色的人之一，我忘了说他，是胡伯图斯・斯特鲁格霍尔德教授，他是太空医学的先驱，他在附近经营一个地下设施，正如我提到的，有一个 SS，特殊的 S3 项目，包括里斯，可能是卢德维科维斯 - 卢德维斯多夫和其他各种地方，设施，其中一个是由胡伯图斯・格霍尔德教授经营的地下空间研究设施

He said about it in an interview for a Polish journalist in the 1960’s or something, I don’t remember, and he has said that he has tested some kind of... he said that it was a simulator of space flight, but actually it was controllable. Namely, that when the propulsion worked very intensively or high energy – it was in volts, something like that – the thing, the cabin capsule-system, whatever, I don’t know, was hard to control, for example. And it was known that this command of children was dedicated to his research post. 他在 20 世纪 60 年代接受波兰记者采访时说，我不记得了，他说他已经测试了某种... ... 他说这是一个太空飞行模拟器，但实际上它是可以控制的。换句话说，当推进器工作得非常集中或者能量非常高的时候 —— 比如以伏特为单位 —— 那个东西，舱内的太空舱系统，我不知道，是很难控制的，例如。大家都知道，这种对孩子的控制是献给他的研究岗位的

So it was assumed that they were used, these children, for experiments, but it cannot be certain, perhaps for other reasons. He was a professor of medicine. So various things are possible. I just don’t know. 所以我们假设这些孩子，被用来做实验，但是我们不能确定，也许是因为其他的原因。他是一位医学教授。所以各种各样的事情都是可能的。我只是不知道

BR: Mmh. 比尔：嗯

KC: Okay, but Chronos. To get back to the notion of the top secret sort of... 好的，但是克罗诺斯。回到最高机密的概念..

IW: Uh-huh. I would just recommend checking it out in the internet or so. 伊恩・沃克：嗯，我建议你上网查查看

KC: Yes, but no, I’m saying that there is something to do with the idea of seeing into the future in Chronos. In other words, I believe it’s the father of... 是的，但是不是，我是说在 Chronos 看到未来的想法是有一定意义的。换句话说，我相信它是... 的父亲

IW: Yeah, I under... IW: 是的，我明白..

KC: ...of time or seeing forward...

IW: I under... I understand that but... IW: 我明白，但是... ..

KC: ...and there’s a link between the Bell and antigravity, and also...

IW: You know... 你知道... ..

KC: ...being able to move into or see through the future... 能够进入或者看到未来... ..

IW: Mm-hm. IW: 嗯哼

KC: ...because there is a link with – of course you won’t be familiar probably with the looking glass, what we know of as looking glass technology... 因为有一个链接 —— 当然你可能不熟悉窥镜，我们所知道的窥镜技术... ..

IW: Uh-huh. IW: 嗯

KC: ...that Dan Burisch talks about.

IW: No, I do not. IW: 不，我不知道

KC: But this is the technology in which you can see into the future. KC: 但是这是一种你可以看到未来的技术

IW: You know, gravity is about time space, so there is no way to disconnect space from time, and gravity from time in this respect, but I don’t think that they would be interested in time. Namely, it wasn’t useful in any, say, in any way to save the Third Reich. IW: 你知道，重力是关于时空的，所以在这方面没有办法把空间和时间分开，也没有办法把重力和时间分开，但是我不认为他们会对时间感兴趣。换句话说，它对于拯救第三帝国毫无用处

KC: Not in any obvious way... 没有任何明显的迹象... ..

IW: Uh-huh. IW: 嗯

KC: ...except for the chosen name Chronos. One... 除了所选择的名字克罗诺斯

IW: No, I... IW: 不，我..

KC: ...would say that it can’t quite be made accidental. 肯定会说这不可能是偶然的

IW: I wouldn’t... yeah... I... yeah. I wouldn’t worry about it, because code names by definition are misleading. 我不会... ... 是的... ... 我... ... 是的。我不会担心这个，因为代号的定义是误导性的

KC: Do you think so? 你这么认为吗？

IW: [laughs] That is cruel. IW: (笑) 这太残忍了

BR: Well, an example of that is Project Paperclip. What does that mean? 比尔: “回形针计划” 就是一个例子。那是什么意思？

IW: The purpose of it. So... IW: 它的目的。所以... ..

KC: Well, they may be misleading on the surface and yet there may be a deeper meaning in terms of the occult... 嗯，它们可能表面上有误导性，但是就神秘学而言，可能有更深层的含义..

IW: As I mentioned... IW: 正如我所提到的... ..

KC: ...because there is often an occult significance that does have actual... between science and symbols. 因为在科学和符号之间，通常存在着一种神秘的意义

IW: It had to be related to time anyway, so it is possible. But I don’t think that they would be interested in using time. IW: 不管怎样，它必须和时间有关，所以这是可能的。但我不认为他们会对利用时间感兴趣

KC: Okay, but in terms of an antigravity, using antigravity as a propulsion system or as a method of what you called getting... in other words, if you’re getting, distributing... 好的，但是就反重力而言，使用反重力作为推进系统或者作为你所谓的获得的一种方法... 换句话说，如果你获得，分配..

IW: Making a weapon to... 制造一种武器..

KC: ...a weapon’s, a delivery system... 一个武器，一个运载系统..

IW: Yeah. IW: 是的

KC: ...it almost seems that that in itself wouldn’t be an efficient means...

IW: It could be. Right. IW: 有可能。对

KC: ...because if you have to... if you use antigravity to get something from one place to another, isn’t it possible that you also, the thing itself, cannot be... it has to lose mater... because it must dematerialize in a sense... 因为如果你不得不... 如果你用反重力把某样东西从一个地方运到另一个地方，有没有可能你，这个东西本身，也不可能... 它必须失去物质... 因为它必须在某种意义上非物质化..

IW: No. IW: 没有

KC: ...to get from one place to another.

IW: No. No. IW: 不，不

KC: Isn’t there a sense of that? KC: 难道没有这种感觉吗？

IW: No. Because various experiments on gravity were conducted and I didn’t hear about such a thing. IW: 没有。因为我们做过各种各样的引力实验，我从来没听说过这样的事情

BR: No. She’s sure. I would actually say that this would be pure cutting edge research that they were doing. They didn’t know where this was going to lead, but they knew that this was something that was unknown and therefore potentially useful, because that’s the way they looked at everything. 比尔：没有。她很肯定。实际上，我认为这将是他们正在做的纯粹的前沿研究。他们不知道这将导致什么，但他们知道这是未知的，因此可能是有用的，因为这是他们看待一切的方式

KC: Well, wouldn’t the... 那么，难道不是..

IW: The most striking, sorry, the most striking thing for me is that they had developed theory, as I mentioned. Professor Pascual Jordan, in connection with Professor Gerlach, had developed a theory describing this on the basis of quantum physics, which could be a breakthrough. Almost nobody knows about it. He was supposed to be, to receive a Nobel Prize after the war for that. IW: 对我来说，最令人震惊，抱歉，最令人震惊的事情是，正如我所提到的，他们已经发展出了理论。帕斯夸尔・乔丹教授与杰拉赫教授合作，在量子物理学的基础上发展了一个描述这一现象的理论，这可能是一个突破。几乎没人知道这件事。他应该在战后因此获得诺贝尔奖

But after his connections, you know, links from the time were revealed partially, somebody else has got the Nobel Prize. But that’s strange thing, because it cannot be debunked. And it was itself a breakthrough. It was... I don’t have to add... 但是在他的关系之后，你知道，那个时候的部分联系被揭露了，其他人获得了诺贝尔奖。但是这很奇怪，因为它是不能被揭穿的。这本身就是一个突破。那是... 我不需要补充..

BR: Mmh. 比尔：嗯

IW: ...that Einstein’s approach wasn’t that obvious for them, for ideological reasons. That’s one reason. And the other one, Germany was amateur on quantum physics.

BR: Mmh. 比尔：嗯

IW: And they had no reasons to believe a theory which is abstracted from everything else in the physical world. That’s... okay. [laughs] IW: 而且他们没有理由相信一个从物理世界的其他事物中抽象出来的理论。没关系。[笑]

KC: Well, maybe because I’m not a physicist, but... 也许因为我不是物理学家，但是... ..

IW: Mm-hm. IW: 嗯哼

KC: ...is there some way you can draw some kind of parallel into... I mean, because you’re acting as though everything needed to be very practical, and yet this in itself is a theory of matter, right?

IW: Mm-hm. IW: 嗯哼

KC: So in a sense, the experiments that, if there was such a thing as the Bell and if they were experimenting with antigravity, in a sense... and it was a delivery system was the end result, then what would be the method of delivery, using antigravity? Would it be a craft of some kind? 所以从某种意义上说，那些实验，如果有贝尔这样的东西，如果他们在实验反重力，在某种意义上... ... 而这是一个传输系统的最终结果，那么使用反重力的传输方法会是什么呢？会是某种工艺品吗？

IW: A craft of some kind. IW: 某种工艺

KC: Would it be... KC: 会是... ..

IW: There, there would... 那里，那里... ..

KC: ...a craft that would, in other words – just let me finish this thought – because thinking about this mountain that you told me, asked me to take a look at, and this sort of rocket or whatever, and I’m wondering would it be useful if the rocket... 换句话说，一架飞船，让我把这个想法说完，因为想到你告诉我的这座山，让我看看，这种火箭之类的东西，我在想，如果火箭..

IW: No. IW: 没有

KC: ...were to use antigravity. In other words, to use a normal propellant to get up...

IW: It wouldn’t be... IW: 不会是... ..

KC: ...but at some point...

IW: It wouldn’t be a rocket. The subject has been described as oblong or ball shaped, and it would just fly everywhere. You know, one of the unresolved aspect of this physics based on these theories is such that in the documents relating to Richter in the American Paperclip files, it has been described... very strange thing. I’m not sure if it will be familiar to you or not, but certain... it could stay behind this decomposing or decaying structures. It’s a long story. IW: 不会是火箭。这个物体被描述成长方形或球形，它会飞得到处都是。你知道，基于这些理论的物理学的一个尚未解决的问题是，在美国回形针文件中有关里克特的文件中，它被描述成... ... 非常奇怪的东西。我不确定你们是否熟悉它，但肯定... 它可能留在这些腐烂或腐烂的建筑物后面。说来话长

I will not tell about it because it will be very long. But as it has been described in this document, a certain exchange mechanism of energy has been detected... discovered. And the result of that was such that apparently energy has appeared out of nothing, which means that, which could have mean, that such a vortices... I just wanted to say that perhaps it didn’t even need any significant amount of power except for the setting it in motion. 我不会告诉别人，因为那会很长。但是，正如本文所描述的那样，已经发现了某种能量交换机制。结果是，显然能量是无中生有的，这意味着，这可能意味着，这样一个漩涡... ... 我只是想说，也许它甚至不需要任何显著的权力，除了设置它的运动

But such a vortex... it’s also called as a ‘ball-shape type vortex’. The main feature of such a thing is that it is isolated from the external... no, I will say differently. I was talking with plasma physicists about vortices in plasma, and he was saying that generally if you have a discharge, electric discharge in plasma, often some vortices are generated, but they are visible only on ultra-fast photographs, because they live for microseconds or nanoseconds or something. 但是这样的漩涡... ... 它也被称为 “球状涡旋”。这种东西的主要特征是它与外界隔绝... ... 不，我要说的不一样。我和等离子体物理学家讨论过等离子体中的漩涡，他说，一般来说，如果你在等离子体中放电，放电，通常会产生一些漩涡，但是它们只能在超高速照片上看到，因为它们只能存活几微秒或者纳秒之类的东西

Because it’s a gas, generally, which is under very high pressure. Very hot. And it dissipates the energy and just didn’t live very long. But on the other hand, you have ball lightning, for example, which lives for a minute. 因为它是一种气体，一般来说，它处于非常高的压强下。非常热。它会消耗能量，并且活不长。但是另一方面，你有球状闪电，例如，它只存在一分钟

BR: Or sometimes longer. 比尔：或者有时候更长

IW: Or sometimes longer. And there is a different, completely different mechanism. It’s not such a normal vortex as we can see normally. Because the fields are isolated, then it’s almost entirely a different world in itself, such a bubble of closed time-space in a way. Because it penetrates obstacles such as glass and... IW: 或者有时更长。这是一个完全不同的机制。它不像我们通常看到的那样是一个正常的漩涡。因为场是孤立的，那么它本身几乎就是一个完全不同的世界，在某种程度上就是一个封闭的时空泡泡。因为它能穿透玻璃和..

BR: Yup. 比尔：是的

IW: ...metal and... 金属和... ..

BR: It goes right through it. 比尔：它正好穿过它

IW: It doesn’t need energy. It needs energy to create it, but once it spins, it don’t, it doesn’t... IW: 它不需要能量。它需要能量来创造它，但是一旦它旋转，它就不，它就不..

BR: Yes. 比尔：是的

IW: ...almost, when compared to, when you compare microsecond with a minute, you have the order of millions. IW: ... ... 几乎，相比之下，当你把微秒和一分钟相比时，你会得到数百万的数量

BR: Yes. Yup. Understood. 比尔：是的，是的，明白了

IW: Perhaps it wouldn’t even need a source of energy, significant source of energy. IW: 也许它甚至不需要一种能源，一种重要的能源

BR: Yes, once it’s created. 比尔：是的，一旦它被创造出来

IW: Various interesting... 各种有趣的... ..

BR: Fascinating topic. 比尔：引人入胜的话题

IW: Yeah. IW: 是的

BR: Fascinating. So, Igor, thank you so much. 比尔：太棒了。所以，伊戈尔，非常感谢你

IW: Yeah, no problem. My pleasure. IW: 好的，没问题。乐意效劳

BR: I have a request for you, actually, this evening if possible. 比尔：事实上，如果可能的话，今晚我有个请求

IW: Mm-hm. IW: 嗯哼

BR: I know there’s a beautiful new book, and I can’t read a word of it, but I’d love to look at some of the images. 比尔：我知道有一本很漂亮的新书，但是我一个字也看不懂，但是我很想看看其中的一些图片

KC: Oh, but it is also striking, this picture that you had. 凯瑟琳：哦，但是你的这张照片也很惊人

IW: There is one more interesting things, maybe not for the camera. IW: 还有一件有趣的事情，可能不是为了摄像机

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

KC: You could turn it off. 你可以把它关掉

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

IW: There is a document about Professor Strughold, the one that was... 有一份关于斯特鲁霍德教授的文件，就是... ..

BR: Strughold, yeah. 比尔：斯特鲁霍德，是的

IW: ...a pioneer of space medicine. IW: ... 太空医学的先驱

BR: Mmh. 比尔：嗯

KC: Oh really. KC: 哦，是吗

BR: And he was taken over in Paperclip. 比尔：他在《回形针》里被接管了

IW: As I mentioned, what kind of experiments you can adapt here. And there is some... it’s from American author, so it’s in English. The Chief of the Department of Space Medicine, at Randolph Air Force Base, he said yesterday, ‘In the field of space medicine, we are not behind anyone. The same things that the Russians are doing with a dog, we are finding out with men.’ IW: 正如我所提到的，你可以在这里适应什么样的实验。还有一些来自美国作家，所以是英文的。兰多夫空军基地太空医学系主任昨天说，在太空医学领域，我们不落后于任何人。和俄罗斯人对狗做的一样，我们也是从男人身上发现的。’

BR: And that is interesting. Yes, yes. 比尔：这很有趣。是的，是的

IW: You know, if you place it in a different context... IW: 你知道，如果你把它放在一个不同的背景下... ..

BR: Yes. This is the... 比尔：是的，这是... ..

IW: It’s written by Strughold. 是斯特鲁霍德写的

BR: Yeah. 比尔：是的

IW: It is written by Strughold. Okay. 是斯特鲁霍德写的，好的

BR: Yes. They may be talking about the dog Laika. 比尔：是的，他们可能在谈论狗莱卡

IW: They didn’t need to... 他们不需要... ..

KC: Is it the dog that went into space? 是那只进入太空的狗吗？

IW: They didn’t need any dog. 他们不需要任何狗

BR: Yes, the name is Laika. 比尔：是的，我叫莱卡

IW: ‘We’re not behind anyone.’ 我们没有落后于任何人

BR: Yeah. 比尔：是的

KC: The Philadelphia Experiment took place in what year? 费城实验发生在哪一年？

IW: I don’t know. I know almost nothing about the Philadelphia Experiment. 我不知道。我对费城实验几乎一无所知

BR: I think that was... 比尔：我想那是... ..

KC: Well, it’s just that it happened after the war, though. 凯瑟琳：不过，这只是战后发生的事

BR: No no, it’s before the war. That was ‘42. 比尔：不，不，那是在战争之前，那是 42 年

IW: I will show you one more thing. IW: 我再给你看一样东西

BR: Yeah. That was ‘41 or ‘42 I think. 比尔：是的，我想那是 41 或 42 年

IW: That is Ludwikowice here. IW: 这里是 Ludwikowice

BR: Yeah. I’d be interested to... I don’t know whether this... 比尔：是的，我有兴趣... ... 我不知道这个是否... ..

KC: Are there Russians living in this part of Poland? 有俄罗斯人住在波兰的这个地区吗？

IW: No. Not at all. IW: 不，一点也不

KC: Okay. 好的

BR: Okay. So I’m looking... now I’ve got an image of the map. 比尔：好的。我正在看... ... 现在我已经得到了地图的图像

IW: Excuse me. IW: 对不起

BR: Okay, go ahead. 比尔：好的，继续

IW: May I say something? IW: 我能说点什么吗？

BR: Yup. 比尔：是的

IW: There is the valley, where the Henge is. The Henge is... that’s the general place, structure, and all this roads here lined up with concrete and they lead to other objects in the entire area. The entire valley was turned into, transformed into a closed, Area 51-like place. IW: 有一个山谷，那里有巨石阵。巨石柱是... 那是一般的地方，结构，这里所有的道路都用混凝土排列，它们通向整个区域的其他物体。整个山谷变成了，变成了一个封闭的，类似 51 区的地方

BR: Yup. That’s a... I’ve got a good image of that. 比尔：是的。那是... ... 我有一个很好的印象

IW: That’s the mountain massive. And that’s, for example, one of the underground facilities. You can see the pattern here. These are sightings of the narrow gauge railway, so you have some idea about infrastructure. It was pretty extensive. IW: 那是一座巨大的山。那就是，比如说，一个地下设施。你可以在这里看到图案。这些都是关于窄轨铁路的图片，所以你对基础设施有一些了解。这是相当广泛的

KC: The railway. You’re talking about a railway. Is that a railway on top of the ground or underneath? 铁路。你说的是铁路。那是在地面上还是地下的铁路？

IW: On top, entering the underground facilities then. 在上面，然后进入地下设施

KC: I see. Was it used originally by the mine? 我明白了。它最初是由矿井使用的吗？

IW: No. There was no mine. It’s the Riese. The mine was on the other... IW: 不，没有地雷。是里斯河。地雷在另一边... ..

KC: Oh. KC: 哦

IW: ...side of the map. Sorry my hand’s shaking.

BR: Okay. Is that a special map about war time activities? Is that what it is? 比尔：好的。这是一张关于战时活动的特殊地图吗？是这样吗？

IW: Yeah. IW: 是的

BR: I saw the swastika on it. Yes. 比尔：我看到上面有纳粹党徽，是的

KC: Bill? 比尔？

BR: Yeah. 比尔：是的

IW: So, maybe you’ll... for example... IW: 所以，也许你会... ... 比如... ..

BR: These docu.... yeah that’s... 比尔：这些纪录片... ... 是的，那是... ..

IW: It’s good. You may possess it later. IW: 很好，你以后可以拥有它

BR: Yes, and this was... yes. 比尔：是的，这是... ... 是的

IW: It’s Sonderbauvorhaben S3. It says that there was a larger undertaking than the Riese, and that it was the largest such a project of the SS at all. And the document... 是 Sonderbauvorhaben s 3。据说有一项比里斯河更大的工程，而且这是党卫军最大的一个这样的工程。还有那份文件..

BR: Which part of it... 比尔：哪一部分... ..

IW: ...is signed by Kammler.

BR: Does it say Kammler? 比尔：上面写的是凯姆勒吗？

IW: Here. It doesn’t say but... IW: 在这里。上面没说但是... ..

BR: It doesn’t... 比尔：它不... ..

IW: ...it’s just his signature.

BR: Okay. Is it important stuff, where it says that it’s the most... 比尔：好的。是不是很重要的东西，上面说它是最..

IW: Just a moment. Okay. IW: 等一下，好的

BR: ...just that little phrase.

IW: The document says that... right here it says: which means Himmler, has ordered certain things to do, but Kammler responds that it is not possible because the office C-4, because there’s this office, is completely engaged with Sonderbauvorhaben S3, and therefore cannot execute such a tasks. It’s absorbed with all its forces, ‘mit allen Kräften,’ with this project. And therefore cannot execute anything else. IW: 文件上说... ... 这里写着：这意味着希姆莱，已经下令做某些事情，但是 Kammler 回答说这是不可能的，因为 C-4 办公室，因为有这个办公室，完全与 Sonderbauvorhaben S3 联系在一起，因此不能执行这样的任务。通过这个项目，它被所有的力量吸收了，‘ mit allen Kräften’。因此不能执行其他任何东西

BR: Okay. 比尔：好的

IW: ‘With all its forces.’ You know, when Kammler responds that all his forces of his office are engaged in something... 国际战略研究所: ‘全力以赴。你知道，当 Kammler 回复说他办公室的所有部队都在忙着某件事... ..

BR: Yeah. It means he’s doing something that’s top priority. 比尔：是的。这意味着他正在做一件最重要的事情

IW: Yeah. IW: 是的

BR: Yes, I understand. Fascinating. 比尔：是的，我明白。太棒了

IW: And at the same time, something unknown, completely. IW: 与此同时，一些未知的，完全的东西

BR: Yes, yes, yup. 比尔：是的，是的，是的

IW: I have a, it not says that it’s Riese, but just a moment. I have such a state from a, it’s a book, it’s called IW: 我有一个，不是说它是里斯，只是一会儿。我有这样一种状态，从一个，这是一本书，它叫List of Code Names of German Underground Undertakings 德国地下企业代号清单.

BR: Oh that’s interesting. Mm-hm. 比尔：哦，那很有趣。嗯

IW: ...which says that the S3 encompassed the Hitler’s headquarters in East Prussia, Riese, Bashalottenbau [Ed. Note: name unclear and correct spelling was not found] was about of the Riese, Rudiger which is a communication center for the Riese, and for the entire area here, and Fürstenstein which was Hitler’s headquarters. Also within the S3 is some 15 kilometers from here. 据说 S3 包围了希特勒在东普鲁士、里泽、巴沙洛坦包的司令部。注：名字不清楚，拼写错误] 是关于里斯人的，Rudiger 是里斯人的通讯中心，整个地区在这里，菲尔斯滕施泰因是希特勒的总部。3 里面距离这里大约 15 公里

BR: Okay. Got it. Thank you. All right. So, thank you very much, Igor, for this fascinating testimony. I know that this is a research in progress. It continues, and I would really like to keep in touch with you to learn what you continue to learn as you’re following this very interesting trail. Thank you. 比尔：好的。知道了。谢谢你。好吧。所以，非常感谢你，伊戈尔，这个有趣的证词。我知道这是一个正在进行的研究。它继续，我真的很想与你保持联系，了解你继续学习什么，因为你正在跟随这条非常有趣的线索。谢谢你

IW: Thank you too. It’s my pleasure. IW: 也谢谢你。这是我的荣幸
